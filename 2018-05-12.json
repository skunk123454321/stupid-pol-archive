It's a means for toxic people to scold others who didn't come out of the womb using correct pronouns. It's about siloing groups who compete in a zero-sum race for oppression cred meanwhile individuals are subsumed into each supposed monolithic identity irrespective of their differences. It's paying lip service to the struggles of others while being monomaniacally absorbed in your own concerns.\n\nAdolph Reed likes to quote Mao's aphorism that \"politics is about uniting the many to defeat the few.\" From one perspective you can say that having a _black_ panthers contributes to balkanizing the left, but Hampton's commitment to solidarity is evident and stands in stark contrast to toxic people who's only motivation seems to be to throw people out of the movement like latter day inquisitors. Hampton organized with the young patriots who prominently displayed the confederate flag as a symbol of their movement. He didn't call them nazi shitbirds who should just go join the kkk already.\n\nI'm reminded of the movements for national liberation in Europe during the nineteenth century. I'm going to butcher this anecdote, but I think it's illustrative of the point I'm making. There was a reactionary Italian priest who was prominent in opposing the revolution of 1848 in Italy and the risorgimento more broadly. I forgot his name. After he made a name for himself across Europe for being a reactionary he visited America for some catholic PR or something. At a stop in Ohio (I believe) he was mobbed and chased out of town by the largely german immigrants of the area for his notorious politics. Many of these immigrants were refuges of the failed revolutions in Germany. They had no connection to Italian nationalism, but they saw their own struggles for liberation reflected in the experience of the Italians and stood in solidarity with them.",

We are socialists because we believe that work must be organized for the collective benefit of those who do the work and create the products, and not for the profit of the bosses. Material resources must be equally distributed among those who create these resources. We are not convinced, however, that a socialist revolution that is not also a feminist and anti-racist revolution will guarantee our liberation.\u00a0\n\nIf you read the CRC's statement you'd see that the BPP and others did actually engage in identity politics as detailed in the originating document regarding identity politics. \n\n&gt; Hampton organised with the young patriots...\n\nIndeed, but the young patriots organization (YPO) were left-wing and opposed racism, housing discrimination, and police brutality. Although the YPO did display the confederate flag, we must admit that society changes and in recent years the confederate flag has become more of a hate symbol. What the populace thought of the flag then is different than now and everyone has a right to free association and all that.

We\u2019re going to fight racism not with racism, but we\u2019re going to fight with solidarity. We say we\u2019re not going to fight capitalism with black capitalism, but we\u2019re going to fight it with socialism. \n\n\n&gt;What he doesn't say: we are going to fight racism with anti-racism or with anti-racism and anti-capitalism in equal measure or with black nationalism.\n\n???  He was explicitly against racism and routinely spoke out against it. That's fundamentally [anti-racism](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/anti-racism) regardless if he designated it as such. I don't understand why you would mention black nationalism as it's not relevant to the topic. Regardless, Identity politics doesn't make any prescriptions of \"anti-racism and anti-capitalism in equal measure.\" You're appending things that are not there.  What the [CRC statement](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html) did say, however, is that identity politics is:\n\n&gt;committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and class oppression, and see as our particular task the development of integrated analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are interlocking. The synthesis of these oppressions creates the conditions of our lives.\n\nNow, here's what Fred Hampton said about racism:\n\n&gt;If we never negated the fact that there was racism in America, but we said that when you, the by-product, what comes off of racism, that capitalism comes first and next is racism. That when they brought slaves over here, it was to make money. So first the idea came that we want to make money, then the slaves came in order to make that money. That means that capitalism had to, through historical fact, racism had to come from capitalism. It had to be capitalism first, and racism was a by-product of that.\n\nHampton blatantly associates racism with capitalism as does identity politics. Again, I am utterly perplexed when anti-identity politics leftists celebrate those who engaged in identity politics. Fred and the BPP never put anti-capitalism above racism. When the YPO wanted to work together with the BPP, the BPP's [only stipulation was that the white YPO denounce racism](http://theconversation.com/chicago-1969-when-black-panthers-aligned-with-confederate-flag-wielding-working-class-whites-68961). If the BPP put anti-capitalism above racism, they would not have made such a requirement.  They would have simply worked with the YPO.\n\nHere's a [quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7F8RfnDhkA) from Hampton rejecting solidarity with  racists:\n\n&gt;If you ever think about me, and if you think about me niggers... forget about me.\n\n Since the OP of this thread mentioned the YPO, here is the decidedly anti-racist quote from founder Hy Thurman:\n\n&gt;Racism was a demon that had to be driven out and slain if we were going to have unity with other groups and to believe that all people have a right to self-determination and freedom\u2026 We had to change to make life tolerable, and for life to have some sort of meaning.\n\nSeeing that the YPO, and the BPP both denounced racism they were, by definition, anti-racist. According to the University of Calgary's CARED Collective (Calgary Anti-Racism Education) antiracism is the \"active process of identifying and eliminating racism by changing systems, organizational structures, policies and practices and attitudes, so that power is redistributed and shared equitably.\" If we look at the actions and speech of the BPP and Fred Hampton, both can be understood as unquestionably anti-racist. \n\n&gt;This is clearly the language of Marxism, not intersectionality and certainly not the mainstream variants of idpol\n\nI agree the mainstream, bastardized neoliberal version of identity politics is obscene. Anti-racism, anti-sexism, etc. without anti-capitalism is worthless. Although intersectionality certainly lacks class analysis, identity politics is undoubtedly Marxist as it realises that \"that the liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political-economic systems of capitalism and imperialism.\"\n\nI dunno, man, we're both socialists, and we both oppose capitalism and Neoliberal identity politics, but the identity politics outlined in the CRC's statement accurately describes the actions of the BPP and Hampton ",

Hampton spells it out in crude Marxist language\n\nI think you're mistaking the language of class struggle as being inherently Marxist. There are other strains of socialist and non-socialist thought that use and employ class struggle outside of Marxism. Somewhat unrelated but I'm uncertain as to whether Hampton explicitly referred to himself as a Marxist. If you have a quote, I'd appreciate it if you cite it here. \n\n&gt;Left-wing idpol speaks about racism and capitalism, as two distinct vectors of oppression (among many) that just so happen to intersect. Hampton says racism is the product of capitalist development.\n\nTwo important things to address here. First, Hampton claims that racism is a product of capitalism does not presume anything other than racism is a product of capitalism. It's a simple association. Additionally, Hampton's statement doesn't imply that racism cannot exist outside of a capitalist society. Second, the left-wing idpol understanding of racism seems to be the more historically accurate understanding of racism.  If racism is indeed inextricably intertwined with capitalism and cannot manifest outside of capitalism, then we would expect racism to disappear in socialist countries. I think we have [enough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Soviet_Union#Greeks) data of both the Soviet Union and [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Cuba) to suggest otherwise. However, that's not to imply that there's no association between racism and capitalism, but it's entirely naive to believe that a socialist revolution will thoroughly eradicate racism or that racism cannot exist outside of capitalism. \n\n&gt;You can term Hampton's Marxist strategy and the concrete \"Black Power\" struggles against segregationists as \"idpol\" if you wish.\n\nI have never suggested that simply opposing segregationists constitutes what we colloquially call \"idpol.\" \"Idpol\" in this context (at least what I have defined idpol as since my first comment) refers to the combination of class struggle **and** race struggle, gender struggle, queer struggle, etc. Which is what the BPP did, so there was not anything \"performative\" about the BPP.\n\n&gt;But I think it's worth drawing a distinction between Marxism and Civil Rights on the one hand and contemporary identity politics (\"leftist\" or otherwise) on the other.\n\nI agree, but 'idpol\" in the common parlance has essentially become, as another user ironically pointed out, \"anything a PoC does.\" \n\nSorry, for the late reply.",

If you are going down that route, then \"socialism\" is and impossible sell. Americans aren't going to trade a tolerable kleptocracy for civil war, famine, gulags and mass graves. The comparison is of course absurd and ahistorical.\n\n\nI see no reason why racism - as we know it today - should persist in any meaningful form in the US after a socialist revolution, because there would be no competition for scarce resources. National chauvinism and xenophobia might persist however, but \"black power\" has no concrete relevance to either of those things. Or to queer liberation and feminism for that matter. If the current left were actually exposed to the sexist culture within the BBP, they would moan about it on twitter for the rest of their lives.\n\nFurthermore the attempts at explicitly antiracist policies both of those countries were fairly extensive, and successful. The Soviet Union enacted affirmative action, *korenizatsya*, and multiculturalism before any other country in the world. This did not however prevent the Stalin regime from starving the former colonial hinterlands of the Tsarist empire, as well as deporting ethnic minorities. This is a contradiction for that proponents of identity politics to mull over very carefully. The regime was committed to the advancement of minorities and nationalities. What it lacked was a commitment to *socialism*.\n\n\n",

If you have a quote, I'd appreciate it if you cite it here. \n\nI haven't read much BPP literature, but the wiki on the BPP will suffice here:\n\n&gt; [The Party] dropped its wholesale attacks against whites and began to emphasize more of a class analysis of society. Its emphasis on Marxist\u2013Leninist doctrine and its repeated espousal of Maoist statements signaled the group's transition from a revolutionary nationalist to a revolutionary internationalist movement. Every Party member had to study Mao Tse-tung's \"Little Red Book\" to advance his or her knowledge of peoples' struggle and the revolutionary process.[86]\n\n\nOne can argue about the depth of their commitment to Marxism, since \"Marxism-Leninism\" was pretty much obligatory for any revolutionary group at the time.\n\n\n\n\n",
