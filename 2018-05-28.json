However if this admission is true, the central claim of the piece that justified its newsworthiness in the first place, that \u2018several passages\u2026 are lifted\u2019 and \u2018cut and pasted\u2019 are also false. There is no way to interpret those words except \u2018verbatim\u2019 copying, which is the damaging claim now widely believed and spread all over the internet and on multiple other blogs and websites because of this piece, repeated and spread by Davis on Twitter.\n\nBelow is a list of all of the examples of mischaracterizations, falsehoods and other problems in the piece itself.\n\n1. Davis suggests I have stolen from Andrew Hartman\u2019s book A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars because I unknowingly repeated a misquotation error in it. But I cite Hartman and his book by name 6 times including just a few lines above the quote, which is intended to make clear that it is a continuation of me drawing from Hartman\u2019s work. Hartman said in response to the piece \u201cI made a tiny mistake in my own book which you repeated. But otherwise, you cited me several times and did not plagiarize whatsoever. I like your book and think this attack is made in bad faith.\u201d\n\n2. The quoted passage about Chateau Heartiste and mine don\u2019t even resemble each other, let alone count as plagiarism. The common words are in bold below. Davis writes:\n\nLater in the chapter, Nagle echoes RationalWiki\u2019s entry on \u201cChateau Heartiste,\u201d a virulently misogynistic and racist \u201cpick-up artist\u201d blog. The site\u2019s proprietor, James C. Weidmann, \u201cbelieves white civilization is being destroyed by miscegenation, immigration and low white female birth rates owing to feminism,\u201d Nagle writes. \u201cThis decline can only be undone, he thinks, by deporting minorities and restoring patriarchy.\u201d\n\nThe RationalWiki entry states that Weidmann \u201cthinks \u2018white civilization\u2019 is getting destroyed as it is \u2018overrun by Uruk-hai,\u2019\u201d a reference to the dark, anonymous \u201corcs\u201d of J.R.R. Tolkien. \u201cThe only solution to the terrible prospect of Whites becoming a minority is, according to Weidmann, to forcefully deport all minorities.\u201d\n\n3. On Roosh V:\n\nDavis then claims that I lifted from an article about Roosh from The Cut. On closer inspection, the only words that are the same are \"a victory for\" and \"movement\". The Roosh quote is in quotation marks and attributed to him.\n\n4. Henderson citation:\n\nDavis claims I don't cite Schwartz in the New York Times in my description of the trolling of a schoolboy, Henderson. While I do cite that article previously, I directly cite Whitney Phillips' book This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things here for that reference, who includes the story of Henderson in her book. Philips has based her summary of events on the New York Times one, which she cites in her footnotes (hers is an academic text) but by leaving out this detail he has intentionally tried to mislead the audience to think there is no citation for it when there is.\n\n5. In the first quote about Kony2012, the only significant consecutive phrases that are the same are \u2018film\u2019s purpose was to promote the charity\u2019 and \u2018arrested by the end of 2012\u2019. These are simply mundane phrases about widely available information that would be likely to occur in any retelling of an event. The next quoted line about Kony2012 is phrased very differently and even gives a differently phrased number by saying \u2018over 100 million\u2019. And again, it is simply retelling widely available information that has been rewritten many ways and many times.\n\n6. On Jordan Peterson:\n\nHe implies that a BBC article on Peterson had been copied by Nagle but the only significant consecutive word sequence he presents is \u201cthe Ontario Human Rights Code\u201d.\n\nThe other claim he makes is that a BBC article and I quote a letter, quoted and attributed, which said the students found Peterson\u2019s gender pronoun stand \u201cunacceptable, emotionally disturbing and painful\u201d and attribute this letter to the University of Toronto when it was from a letter, Davis says, \u201cleaked by Peterson, that was signed by a dean and a vice provost\u201d\u2026 Right. So it was a letter from the University of Toronto then, attributed to the university by multiple news sources.\n\nEverything else about Peterson is bulked up for several paragraphs trying to imply my secret affinity for him. At this stage, Davis seems to have temporarily forgotten that he\u2019s supposed to be thinly veiling his political motivations and doesn\u2019t include any examples of alleged plagiarism.\n\n7. Davis says my retelling of the Germaine Greer story uses the same structure, facts, and phrasing as that of a newspaper report by Claire Lehman but doesn\u2019t present examples, it only says that she is one of a group of \u201cright-wing\u201d writers who I channel. The main similarities in phrasing are that we both mention key facts such as a petition that has now been co-signed by more than 2,000 people and a quote from the same key figure, the women's officer at Cardiff University Students' Union, Rachael Melhuish, fully attributed.\n\n8. Davis implies that the Sokal affair description was plagiarized. Most of the similarities here are simply the basic facts necessary to describe the event like \u20181996\u2019 or that he was \u2018a physics professor at New York University\u2019, the name of the journal in which it was published and some of its star writers. This affair has been written about hundreds of times or more. It would be like saying you needed to link to Wikipedia if your description of WW2 included the dates, the main actors, and the locations.\n\n9. Davis has claimed that this is not a politically motivated attack, but there is a background to this that brings Davis\u2019 motivations and journalistic ethics here into question. Davis continues to amplify attacks against me from obscure blogs full of claims most would find hair-splitting and even bizarre. Davis has gained a reputation for attacking and destroying the reputations of anti-war leftist writers (https://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/online-trolls-syria-alt-left?amp) who he sees as being part of a sinister alliance with the far right, a \u2018red-brown alliance\u2019. Just about everything Davis thinks of as proof of membership of this alliance, from his claim that the Corbynite Diane Abbott is a \u2018nativist\u2019 and Corbynism is \"old-fashioned, nationalist leftism\" to his characterization of France\u2019s trade union stalwart Melenchon as a closet reactionary, to his belief that leftist opposition to invasion in Syria is part of a shady project of Kremlin influence, have clearly put me in his line of fire. In recent weeks on Twitter, I had been primarily tweeting in support of Corbyn and Melenchon against the invasion of Syria, which was around the time he began retweeting attacks on me.\n\n10. Any lack of clarity in the example linking me to Aleksandr Dugin was based on a few consecutive words, an innocent oversight of punctuation that was not corrected in redrafting. The implication that this connects me to him politically, which Davis has been amplifying on Twitter and implies in the piece but later rows back on at the very end of his piece, does not stand up to scrutiny as it would contradict the rest of the contents of the book and all my other writing on these ideologies to date. There was one significant common phrase in the example from The Verge, though it was also a retelling of publicly available information, not an original argument or idea, and one case of common phrasing of information mentioned that should have been correctly cited to a source or rephrased more fully, the lines about Elam, though even that was mostly bulked up in the middle with an attributed quote. Neither of these involved \u2018cut and pasting\u2019 because they were phrased differently as a whole. The similarities were nevertheless there and an innocent editorial oversight, due to haste and my working from old research notes, which will be corrected in the revised edition, out soon. Ultimately Davis failed to show a single example that stands up to his central claim that I simply cut and pasted passages and paragraphs verbatim, which the editors have already begun to retract.",

The NYT article you linked literally states that the program was not adequate to overthrow Assad:\n\n&gt;\u201cIn many ways, I would put the blame on the Obama administration,\u201d Mr. Lister said of the C.I.A. program. \u201cThey never gave it the necessary resources or space to determine the dynamics of the battlefield. They were drip-feeding opposition groups just enough to survive but never enough to become dominant actors.\u201d\n\nIf the aim of the Obama admin was truly to overthrow Assad, then why not launch a long term bombing campaign against it? Why not give the rebels anti-aircraft weapons? Do you honestly believe that a country with a 600 billion dollar military budget couldn't have overthrown Assad if it really wanted to?\n\n&gt;But I guess according to the woke left interventionists I should feel really guilty about supporting the people of Syria as well as the Kurds against ongoing foreign intervention\n\n1) wtf are you talking about? the Kurds are literally the beneficiaries of American intervention, which they requested. The only reason the PYD controls as much territory as it does is because of US (and allied) air power, the same air campaign that has killed thousands of Syrian civilians. Strange how you don't see any ANSWER Coalition demonstrations against that, but most of the left is in full solidarity with a handful of Assad's bombed empty buildings.\n\n2) If you were truly concerned about protecting the Syrian people from foreign intervention (as if being murder and raped by domestic Syrian forces is somehow better) then you would be opposed to Russian and Iranian intervention in Syria, which has proven itself far more destructive and murderous than American intervention.\n\nIn any case your obsession with foreign intervention, as opposed to any analysis of domestic Syrian politics (outside of orientalism caricatures of all-encompasing sectarianism) shows you have no real regard for the lives, views or agency of actual Syrians. You have no real politic analysis outside of a crude geopolitics you learned from hezbollah fan boys in twitter.\n\n&gt;by supporting the aspirations of the diverse peoples of Syria I am actually an Islamophobe that supports a repressive dictatorship\n\nwhen have the peoples of Syria ever been able to attain these aspirations? last time they tried was in 2011 and they only thing they got from the Lion of Damuscus was bullets and torture. How exactly do you think Syrians will be able to attain these aspirations once Assad conquers what is left of Syria? In what way are you supporting these aspirations?\n\n&gt;Any bias that leftists or ordinary Americans have towards supporting diverse civil society or democratic confederalism as preferable to Sharia law is just us imposing our imperialist Western eurocentrism on the Syrian people. \n\nwtf kind of caricature are you arguing against? \n\n&gt;It's another instance where the bizarre logic of identity politics contributes to the smothering of anti-war activism and solidarity.\n\nyeah dude I'm the idpol one for taking a nuanced view about Syria instead of mindlessly pretending America is the cause of all evil in the world.",

He did not overthrow Assad precisely because he didn't want to scuttle Iran deal negotiations.\n\n&gt;Your response is actually exactly what I'm talking about in terms of cynically playing on the guilty conscience of leftists and attempting to distract attention from the real issue to be debate\n\nA prerequisite for having an actual debate on this subject is a basic grasp on the facts, which most \"anti-imperialists\" don't have. It means recognizing that:\n\n(1) Bashar al-Assad is an extremely repressive multi-billionaire dictator whose neolib policies led to massive environment damage, poverty and inequality. \n\n(2) That because of those policies Syrians in 2011 peacefully demonstrated, for which they were met with extreme violence. \n\n(3) That such violence spurred army defections and the formation of rebel groups.\n\n(4) that Assad is responsible for the vastajority of civilian casualties\n\n(5) that his regime is not secular and is backed up by dozens of IRGC-trained shia jihadi militias\n\n(6) that Assad has consistently used chemical weapons and that kids who choke to death in chlorine deth attack videos re in fact not crisis actors\n\n(7) that Assad is despised by most Syrians and Arabs generally\n\n(8) that the violence won't end if Assad wins\n\nBut since most of the online left seems to get its news from obvious propagandists like Rania Khalek, and instinctively dismisses MSM and actual Syrians, that isn't going to happen. There is no point debating American foreign policy with people who live in an alternate reality.\n\n&gt; You also don't seem to have any objection to the notion that it's NATO's job to police the region, litigate these conflicts, and claim the resources. \n\nI do, but I recognize that the US isn't the main driver of the war, and as such attention should be payed to other things as well. Meanwhile you seem to believe that the Kurds are somehow fighting *against* American intervention instead of benefiting from it. \n\nWhat angers me is the massive hypocrisy of people who claim to be against intervention, while ignoring that the bulk of US intervention in Syria is in aid of the YPG, sometimes even actively supporting it. Tgere have been no demonstrations from the so-called anti-war left against supporting the YPG, while an inconsequential bombing in which 4 people were injured caused a massive uproar and demonstrations. It just shows that these people are pro-Assad and not anti-war or anti-intervention. These people have no real position on Syria worth debating.\n\n&gt;And it seems dishonest to deny that the intervention has ended--\n\nYour article was about the CIA's train and equip program, which was terminated in mid-2017. You specifically referred to this program as \"an ongoing and expensive regime-change intervention in Syria.\" And then said \" It continues today.\" Which is patently false, since even the headline of the NYT article states the program stopped.\n\n&gt;there are still American troops and bases \n\nIn support of the YPG, not the rebels. It's not aimed at Assad or \"regime change\".\n\n&gt;I suppose in your opinion the activists who opposed the Vietnam War in the USA were orientalists and supporters of Ho Chi Minh's war crimes who had no regard for the lives and welfare of Vietnamese people?\n\nThere is no analogy between Vietnam and Syria. If anti-Vietnam war activists were actively covering up the North's crimes and that all of the boat refugees were fake bourgeois dogs, then the abswer would be yes. But by and large they did no such thing, they correctly identified the root cause of the war as the US backing of an unpopular regime in South Vietnam,(the modern left vis a vis Syria does no such thing) and made no excuses for North Vietnam's war crimes, also recognizing who was the biggest killer in Vietnam (which the modern left also doesn't do vis a vis Syria)",

You've been arguing that Obama was trying to overthrow Assad.\n\n&gt; Setting aside the high liklihood then and now that the CIA was steering events\n\nwhere? how? the cia doesn't control the world, be precise\n\n\n&gt;I'm generally in agreement that it's hypocritical to support aid to YPG and oppose intervention, which is why I think we should be discussing opposing all ME interventions including active aid to the YPG and advocating military withdrawal from the region (shuttering CENTCOM).\n\nthen ISIS would still be as powerful as ever dude\n\n&gt;But I can at least understand why withdrawing support from YPG was/is a controversial position worth debating and why the USA intervention might deserve some approbation on this front. \n\nso are you not uniformly against all US intervention?\n\n&gt;But I can't understand why it's considered important for the the West to keep a bloody proxy war b/w the regime and the Nusra/ISIS/AlQaida going with no better justification than memories of events from 2011 or 2013. \n\nbecause not everyone in the Syrian opposition is AQ, plenty of fighters and civilians aren't\n\n&gt;Unless of course the proponent is shilling for neocon/neoliberal interests (including their interpretation of America's role in the world and right to intervene) and wants to obscure the allied role in keeping the rebel insurgency going.\n\nsure dude \"neolib/neocon\" interests are paying me to post on a subreddit with fewer than 200 subscribers, I've even infiltrated to such an extent that I'm now a mod.\n\n&gt;he anti-war movement was castigated over and over again by Harringtonian pro-war libs like you for siding with Ho Chi Minh and evil communism over the legitimate desires of the people of Vietnam.\n\nexcept Bashar al-Assad isn't a widely admired colonial independence leader, he provoked a popular uprising against himself by killing demonstrators. The US isn't occupying a part of Vietnam in an effort to keep a deeply unpopular dictatorship from being overthrown.\n\n&gt;n the present-day pro-war libs that want to keep the proxy war going at all costs, irrespective of the consequences of arming and supporting terrorists and the ensuing refugee crisis.\n\n\"terrorist\" is definitely a word real leftists shoud use.\n\n",
