                "selftext": "## How a clerical error led to witch hunt against a DSA member. \n\n*The member in question is [Amber A'Lee Frost](https://www.keywiki.org/Amber_Frost), co-host of Chapo Trap House, former DSA NPC member and an organizer at-large for the DSA's Medicare For All campaign.*\n\n\n### What happened\n\nSometime in late 2017, the DSA Disability Working Group (DWG) sends an email to the DSA's M4A Committee (M4AC) stating that they wish to provide input regarding the M4A campaign. The Disability Working Group then [loses access to the email account from which the email was sent and gets a new address without notifying M4A or the DSA]\n(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw_GLFuNtjNTMs8VV3qgo_6fAXqUIlTZ4Cc3TON9a6GM_djQ/viewform)\nNor was the DWG's [new](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/950141602714046464) email [posted anywhere where M4AC could see it](https://twitter.com/DSADisability/status/949832969556029440). As a consequence, DWG fails to receive any emails from M4AC.\n\n### What happened Next\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n1.  DWG member and Boston DSA co-chair [Peter Morency](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/949684294309613568) announces on twitter that DWG was not [consulted by M4A, and says this compromises the DSA's M4A program](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/947890190898683906).\n\n2. [Rose](https://twitter.com/EmmaCaterine/status/949677538162376705)-[Gate](https://twitter.com/EmmaCaterine/status/474720020644106240) twitter [trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7og946/amber_nagle_frost_does_it_again_lol/) - not DWG itself - get wind of of the fact that DWG has not communicated with M4A, and manufacture a moral panic to tear down the DSA's flagship M4A campaign over \"ableism\", under the assumption that  M4AC failed to communicate with DWG due to bigotry against the disabled. \n\n3. In a private facebook group, Amber A'Lee [dismisses the trolls, with screen clippings of their anonymous tweets](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DS0ZbvAX0AEMGOu.jpg:large), argues that DSA members with genuine concerns would [communicate internally](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DS5wvLEVQAAav2f.jpg) instead of dragging the organization online. One of the participants of the group leaks facebook comments, which then appear on [twitter](https://twitter.com/razlime/status/949443075281227776) and spark a broader [witch hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7og946/amber_nagle_frost_does_it_again_lol/) against the DSA member on [social media](https://twitter.com/sadydoyle/status/949777297304891393) ([[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7otzk0/discussion_thread_amber/dsc9d2e/)[[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7oulri/ambers_thoughts_on_rchapotraphouse/)[[3]]. The DSA member gets called a \"messy bitch\", a drug addict and an [anti-semite](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7p07qs/authoritative_summary_of_ambergate_so_nobody_has/dsdi9b5/) (for posting a story by Richard Wright) and gets diagnosed with [\"untreated mental problems\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/8cz2wl/effort_post_most_of_americas_problems_can_be/dxj5qzd).\n\n4. Peter Morency announces  on twitter that DWG has [resumed email communication with M4A](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/949125087696998401).\n\n5. Instead of defending the M4A campaign and the Frost against the smears on social media, DSA members and sympathisers join the witch hunt on social media in large numbers.\n\n6.  [DWG issues their first public statement on the \"affair\", noting the clerical error and clearing M4A of any wrongdoing](https://twitter.com/DSADisability/status/949762081242435584). Nonetheless, the DWG [eventually gets around to accusing the M4A organizer of \"ableism\"](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/950455478970142720)]\n\n\n7. [Two DWG members circulate petition calling for reform of M4AC and Frost's \"resignation\" from the Committee](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/950760958854615040). Since Frost had no formal role with M4AC, the original demand for her \"resignation\" had to be revised:\n&gt;  immediately remove herself from any involvement, official or unofficial, with DSA's Medicare for All campaign, and should she not, that she be removed. We demand that DSA Disability be given representation at the highest level of this campaign\nThe petition was signed by over a hundred DSA members.\n\n8. Five months on, the [witch hunt continues](https://twitter.com/petermorency/status/994596103491346433), with Peter Morency calling out ableism in the DSA, over Frost being allowed to talk to members about M4A and a canvassing workshop being held in an old building without elevators.\n\n\nIt has now been proven that \"leftist\" idpol trolling is totally different from [liberal idpol trolling](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/7oprny/a_jacobinghazi_retrospective/).

A couple of points in follow up.\n\nCurrently the majority of DSA is inclined to mass politics and, while probably sympathetic to the idea of idpol, really isn't attracted to extremes such as DWG attacks on national figures. I am fully confident that the drama that plays out on twitter and medium barely registers with that majority. I suspect that a majority of that majority are basically normies. \n\nYou mentioned EBDSA, and I think the opposition faction there (Working Class Unity and Power) is more or less representative of the coalition of groups that cling to the subculture version of DSA, whether they know it, like it, or otherwise. It's a coalition of people who live exclusively in the world of idpol and make few if any marxist political arguments (effectively liberals), and people who are convinced for a variety of reasons that DSA ought to immediately form a new party  (Refoundation, generally speaking). Some other groupings that probably overlap within and without that opposition are sectarian entryists (particularly IMT), anarchists, and Occupy nostalgists. A majority of this coalition either downplays or disavows electoral politics, and, again, I think this the composition of the opposition nationally and in EBDSA.\n\nMy main point here is that you're absolutely right that electoral success will raise the profile of the organization and draw in new people, primarily those inclined to electoral work. Marxist political education will be critical at that point to make sure that we don't go the way of \"North Star\" Caucus and reboot the old realignment strategy, but the only way to break out of the subculture will be to bring in more normal people. I'm not sure that people currently opposed to idpol and other bad politics in DSA can actually win over the identity politicians and subculture warriors.",

In particular, anti-electoralism really does appear to be the common denominator of the various subcultural/idpol tendencies, to the extent that the mobilization of idpol frequently appears to be not an end in itself, but rather a wrecking tool deployed more or less explicitly to sabotage electoral efforts. Opposing the M4A campaign in general, sabotaging specific M4A events (DWG, NYC), pushing for baroque accessibility guidelines (DWG, NY, Boston, DC), insisting on endorsement procedures so byzantine that candidates explicitly say they won't bother to fill out the forms (Boston), leaking opponents' private correspondence on social media (DWG, EB), creating internal cultures explicitly alienating to working class people - all of these activities make sense only if you understand their ultimate goal to be the crippling of the DSA's electoral activities and its ability to attract a mass membership.\n\nThis is why I've been trying to push electoral reform as one of the DSA's key activities. At present there's an anti-electoralist faction (including \"immediate third-partyists\" like Refoundation) and a pro-entryist faction (North Star), and then a middle 75% or so who are ideologically third-partyist but provisionally entryist. But at present this isn't really a coherent approach to electoralism, since no one has really enunciated how to make the transition from entryism to third-partyism. I think the missing link is pushing for electoral reform via ballot initiative, and treating the achievement of such reforms in a given jurisdiction as the trigger to begin the shift from an entryist to a third-partyist strategy.",

I generally hesitate to ascribe malicious intent to larger groupings, particularly the coalition we're talking about, so I take people at their word when they say they don't want to sabotage M4A or electoral work. Of course, the net effect of their actions tends to be sabotage. I actually think this comes more from strategic incompetence than anything else, but there are definitely groups that actively oppose electoral work. NYC is also a huge chapter, and there are lots of good people there. Their recent steering committee election brought in pro-electoral leadership, for example.  \n\n\nDescribing the middle 75&amp;#37; percent as *provisionally* entryist in relation to the dems is a great framing. I'd put that figure a little lower and the figure for North Star a little higher.  \n\n\nI have mixed feelings about the concept of a coherent approach to electoral work. While I firmly believe we need to have good strategy in all our work, I also think we need greater flexibility than even some of my allies would permit. What I mean by that is that I think we can get too bogged down in grand strategy and very long term thinking, particularly in tying that to the \"right\" Marxist analysis. Right now DSA should be laser focused on big campaigns that raise the profile of the organization and drive recruitment (especially recruitment of the type of people who will break out of the subculture). The transition to a third party will happen, but we are so far out from it that we don't need to be that concerned with how our present work connects to the work of forming a new party. Instead, we should be learning how to run effective campaigns from people with the right experience (former dem operatives and volunteers) and educating them in Marxist/revolutionary politics so that they take on that mindset of provision dem entryism.",

The other day in my electoral working group we were debating whether we should endorse candidates in internal Democratic Party races (e.g. for state party committee and DNC seats), which a lot of people found to be an unacceptable degree of entryism, but I'm all for that kind of stuff.\n\nI think electoral reform is key because it has synergy with the \"big campaigns and recruitment\" strategy: it is in itself a promising \"big campaign,\" since ending the two party system is an overwhelmingly popular stance with the general public, and it helps reinforce in the minds of new members that the DSA's end goal lies outside of the Democratic Party without being alienatingly anti-electoralist. In some ways I think electoral reform is even more promising than M4A as a campaign, because while it's not as popular it's a lot more achievable at the municipal and state level via ballot initiative, meaning chapters can rack up victories on their own, without the frustrations inherent in pressuring recalcitrant state legislatures to take action.",

Alexandria Ocassio-Cortez's campaign is all about how she will represent her community in contrast to Joe Crowley (who basically moved to the DC 'burbs). Furthermore, these campaigns, particularly bread and butter ballot initiatives like SF's right to counsel victory, provide a great sense of community, and they legitimize DSA in the eyes of working people. \n\nOn the other hand, the break lights repair initiative, which is probably DSA's flagship serve the people project to date, has, frankly, failed. I was actually very excited about that project when I first read about it, and I voted in favor of my own chapter endorsing, which it did. Unfortunately there just haven't been that many repair clinics organized, and I've heard reports of dismal numbers (people contacted, repairs made, members mobilized) from around the country. That's not to say that there aren't other initiatives we could do, but I do think it's quite strong evidence that we shouldn't be spending much time on that project.   \n\n\nBut, you seem to be focused on the issue of coalitions, and I still don't understand your argument that electoral campaigns don't build them.  \n",

Well, no doubt, there were lots of details there.  But fundamentally there was just sufficient pressure from both sides of the issue that the party couldn't reach a consensus -- so lots of the party was willing to break off and form a new one.\n\nSame deal with the Democrats, if there's to be a third party to displace them, it will be because there is irreconcilable conflict within the Democratic Party about some issue or set of issues or political vision etc..  Like if half the Democrats in office are explicit self-declared socialists and the other half refuse to accept their agenda, then a new party division seems to be just something that would happen naturally.  Some group of people with popular backing declare themselves the leaders of a new party, and then others join them.  Simple, no?  What am I missing here?",
