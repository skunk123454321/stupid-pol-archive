Wilkerson, who won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting while at The New York Times and whose previous book, “The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America’s Great Migration,” won the National Book Critics Circle Award, avoids words like “white” and “race” and “racism” in favor of terms like “dominant caste,” “favored caste,” “upper caste” and “lower caste.”\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;She poses the question so many intellectuals and pundits on the left have posed, with increasing befuddlement: Why do the white working classes in America vote against their economic interests?\n\n&gt;She runs further with the notion of white resentment than many commentators have been willing to, and the juices of her argument follow the course of her knife. What these pundits had not considered, Wilkerson writes, “was that the people voting this way were, in fact, voting their interests. Maintaining the caste system as it had always been was in their interest. And some were willing to accept short-term discomfort, forgo health insurance, risk contamination of the water and air, and even die to protect their long-term interest in the hierarchy as they had known it.”\n\n\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Wilkerson has written a closely-argued book that largely avoids the word “racism,” yet stares it down with more humanity and rigor than nearly all but a few books in our literature.\n\n\n****\n\nAnother review:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/running-deeper-than-race-americas-caste-system/2020/07/30/501af19a-c7a5-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html\n\n&gt;Wilkerson’s visit had been prompted by a book she was writing that used the Indian caste system to illuminate America’s racial hierarchy. It was her first trip to India, but one aspect of what she saw there seemed instantly familiar. She quickly discovered that, as an African American woman schooled in the folkways of race in her home country, she could easily distinguish upper-caste Indians from Dalits, or Untouchables. In turn, “Dalits . . . gravitated toward me like long-lost relatives.” Patterns of deference and social performance marked caste onto her hosts’ bodies, even when Indians did their best to shake them off.\n\n&gt;Wilkerson spent much of the 2010s researching and writing her book, just as the United States was moving in a direction that seemed to validate its thesis. A series of killings of African Americans, often by police officers, helped birth a new anti-racist social movement. Athletes knelt, monuments to slavery began to come down, reparations for enslavement and its long aftermath became a mainstream idea, and the politics of White grievance took over the White House. When she finished her book, she titled it “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.” Wilkerson’s thesis is that Americans’ current obsession with race is somewhat misplaced, for there is a deeper and more intractable system that hides behind the chimera of race, and that system is properly called American caste.\n\n&gt;...\n\n\n\n&gt;Caste has its origins in slavery, where “there emerged a ladder of humanity, global in nature,” with “the English Protestants at the very top” while all others “rank in descending order” until one comes to the “African captives transported to build the New World.” These Africans were analogous to the “mudsill,” she writes — the wooden beam that anchors a house to its foundation and provides support for the whole structure. Since the Civil War era, many commentators have referred to Black Americans as the essential mudsills of our society. Caste is like a “container” for the aspirations of these darker-skinned Americans, Wilkerson argues — a set of unstated assumptions about where and how they are supposed to exist. While there have been a variety of racial regimes as the country has moved from slavery to freedom to the post-civil-rights era, the assumptions of caste have remained relatively constant, often invisible and nearly impossible to dislodge.\n\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;Wilkerson’s book is a powerful, illuminating and heartfelt account of how hierarchy reproduces itself, as well as a call to action for the difficult work of undoing it, but the fundamental conceit that drives its analysis is one of recognition. Wilkerson sees something familiar about the Dalits in India, and about the racial hierarchies that the Nazi regime constructed in Germany. “Throughout human history,” she asserts, “three caste systems have stood out” — those of the United States, India and Nazi Germany. Indeed, a central section of the book is devoted to setting out the “eight pillars of caste.”","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596410880,"distinguished":null,"edited":"1596411949.0","gildings":{},"id":"g05kd99","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_i2m3nq","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_i2m3nq","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2m3nq/isabel_wilkersons_caste_is_an_instant_american/g05kd99/","retrieved_on":1596415359,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"ItsTheTruthBitch2","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_7byh2uaq","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"I'd actually have to read this book to comment meaningfully on it but my main argument against these kinds of notions have always been that literally no voting demographic except wealthy white people ever vote for \"working class interests\". \n\nWe saw it in South Carolina this election cycle.

Party](https://socialistmotherlandparty.blogspot.com/?m=1) website, because - after years of liberal thought-floss - I need a philosophical detox.\n\nFinally, I’m going out to join my local food coop because after years of vapid posturing and pointless symbolism, I’ve decided to actually do something real to help the working class.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596437564,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g06ny2h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2m35f","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_i2m35f","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2m35f/the_daily_topics_on_my_local_facebook_blm_group/g06ny2h/","retrieved_on":1596437574,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"CaliforniaAudman13","author_flair_background_color":"transparent","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"deeply,

Women don’t know who are the ‘good guys’ so in some situations,  sex segregated spaces make sense. \n\nFor example, I’ve obviously come into contact with a lot of unknown men in my life and only 5 have started wanking inappropriately . So I don’t expect most men to start wanking unexpectedly, but I think it’s a possibility that a rare man will masturbate in public without warning.

It isn't. 'I don't know' is not a coherent philosophical position - it's just 'I don't know'. Agnosticism is specifically the philosophical claim that says: \"we can't know\". This is a claim regarding the extent of human knowledge, it is not a statement on faith, which is why Agnosticism is a position completely independent from Atheism/Theism and not a third option.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596541050,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g0bes4s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2lbxb","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g07cq1x","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2lbxb/after_sharing_500000_posts_a_week_about_womxn/g0bes4s/","retrieved_on":1596541061,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}]},{"Post":{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"author":"surviving_r-europe","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Enlightened Centrist "}],"author_flair_text":"Enlightened Centrist ","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_4ck86df7","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_mod_post":false,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1596407120,"domain":"self.stupidpol","full_link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/i2l3ud/it_will_never_get_old_to_me_how_there_are_actual/","gildings":{},"id":"i2l3ud","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":62,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2l3ud/it_will_never_get_old_to_me_how_there_are_actual/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1596407131,"score":1,"selftext":"But when people tell liberals they're only boosting Trump's support, they're like \"nah, that's a reactionary take\".","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","subreddit_subscribers":43410,"subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"It will never get old to me how there are actual, literal Trump supporters explicitly saying that liberal idpol pushed them to the right...","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/i2l3ud/it_will_never_get_old_to_me_how_there_are_actual/","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_template_id":"72f2ae6c-8d26-11e8-a036-0eefae9c5502"},"Comments":[{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"PaXMeTOB","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Marxist-Loraxist"}],"author_flair_template_id":"b2d2374a-1efd-11ea-8e49-0e3c6f50b40b","author_flair_text":"Marxist-Loraxist","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_39mhnpr0","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"we've had multiple users here recognize over time that they genuinely preferred a class-based and materialist political framework, but they were so off-put by liberal wokeness that they had been willing to tolerate rightoid idpol in order to avoid it.\n\n'The real movement to abolish the present state of things' includes recognizing that idpol is the class politics of the liberal capitalist elite.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596411182,"distinguished":null,"edited":"1596411501.0","gildings":{},"id":"g05kvt6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2l3ud","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_i2l3ud","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2l3ud/it_will_never_get_old_to_me_how_there_are_actual/g05kvt6/","retrieved_on":1596415632,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"ThisSentenceIsFaIse","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_5jxphiqd","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"It’s a religion.

The anti-populism book by Thomas Frank seems interesting like the rest of his work, but only for the history. The cultural critic that Taibbi toes the line on, is just his conservative agenda bullshit creeping in. Lets keep it 100 here. \n\n****\n\nMy problem with Taibbi and his ilk of contrarians who always seem to be unsatisfied with \"coastal elites\" pushing their weird social politics into the midwest as if its some nefarious plot to avoid addressing class issues is that they **never tell you what cultural elements they would personally abandon or ask for to not be endorsed**\n\n&gt;In Frank’s home state of Kansas, voters reacted by moving right as the triumvirate of news media, pop culture, and Democratic politics spoke to them less and less. “The state,” he wrote, “watches impotently as its culture, beamed in from the coasts, becomes coarser and more offensive by the year.”\n\n&gt;Perceiving correctly that there would be no natural brake on this phenomenon, since the executive set was able to pay itself more and more as the country grew more divided, Frank wondered, “Why shouldn’t our culture just get worse and worse, if making it worse will only cause the people who worsen it to grow wealthier and wealthier?”\n\nOK, Matt, which elements of \"culture\" do you want to not address or have the left not elevate?\n\nWhat is it that you have a problem with? Is it the police brutality protests? Is it women's marches? Is it the gays? The trans issues? Which is it? Is it Beyonce? Kaepernick? Rap music?\n\nI mean at some point you need to tell us what culture product is just ***SO GRATING*** to these poor folks (because trust me, we're all F'd up out here financially) that if we abandon it, we can finally have our multi-racial class focused policy moment? \n\nI mean I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt when he referenced **crude art** as reason enough for the white lower and middle classes from rejecting democrats:\n\n&gt;Frank in 2004 wrote about how confused Midwestern voters were, watching TV images of the beautiful people of the time. **Movie stars and hedge-funders donned ribbons in support of animals or the “underprivileged,” while spending huge sums on pictures of Jesus covered in ants or on crucifix-shaped popsicles that supposedly were comments on “fanaticism and violence.”** This, while factory towns were basically being moved en masse to China.\n\nSee, but he does THAT reference in the middle of the piece. You know what he ends on? See if you catch it. \n\n\n\nWhen it comes time to dismount from his floor exercise of really sticking it to those money grubbing coastal elites he again deflects but subtly reminds his readers who the real problem for this fracture rests on **culturally**\n\nTaibbi never mentions it... but he gets VERY close...but be careful. He'll accuse you of imparting ill intentions if call this a \\*TRIGGER WARNING* ...*^dogwhistle*: \n\n\n&gt;Once Sanders was out of the way, those same news outlets embraced a significantly more radical ideology, one that swore a lot, described everyone to the right of Ibram Kendi as a white supremacist, and told small business owners they should put up with their stores being smashed for the cause of progress.\n\n&gt;The history outlined in The People, No predicts this. America’s financial and political establishment has always been most terrified of an inclusive underclass movement. So it evangelizes a bizarre transgressive politics that tells white conservatives to fuck themselves and embraces a leftist sub-theology that preaches class as a racist canard. Same old game, same old goal: keep people divided. The only cost to the “consensus thinkers” who will likely re-take the White House under Joe Biden is, they will have to join Nike and Bank of America in flying a “Black Lives Matter” banner above a conference room or two as they re-take their seats at the controls of the S.S. Neoliberalism.\n\n\nReally Matt? \n\nEither I'm dumb or Matt thinks I'm dumb... \n\nSo basically even the slightest effort at black people doing ANYTHING is enough to push white Americans away from class solidiarity?\n\n\n... but this is just selling Taibbi's supposed rhetorical mastery short.

You may notice that the anti-illegal inmigration rethoric focus exclusively on the inmigrants and never on the people hiring them. This is ultimately just another instances of Yankee Idpol being used to divide the working class.\n\nNo doubt.\n\n&gt;The Democrat rethoric is more insidious, as it's filled with empty promises but ultimately its goal is the preservation of the status quo, they don't just want to keep the illegal inmigrants, they want to keep the inmigrants in their illegal status.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this was the case for various reasons, but their rhetoric (which is a front for ulterior motives, of course) follows the pattern of supporting an easier path to citizenship. This seems to be one of the few cases where Democrats talk about cutting red tape while Republicans talk about putting down more of it. But talk is talk.\n\n&gt;An illegal immigrant is doomed to be a scab even if he doesn't want to.\n\nI have noticed this dynamic. Often the language barrier, along with mutual prejudices, makes it hard for American laborers to communicate about unionization with their immigrant coworkers.\n\n&gt;Because if he demands better conditions he will be deported. \n\nThis too.\n\n&gt;As such this perpetual underclass of illegal inmigrants is benefitial to both the republican and the democrat;\n\nI agree. They are beneficial whether they are in the country or not, though. The company I used to work for emails entire data processing projects to India. Just through email. You don't need people to actually be present in order to undercut labor, though it certainly helps with certain kinds of work, particularly manual labor that has to be done on-site. \n\n&gt; as it creates a source of cheap labor and serves as an easy target for the deranged blood and soil idpol bullshit.\n\nI always ask the blood and soil dipshits why they aren't angry at automation and outsourcing and the truth is they often benefit from it. A lot of people in software I've met are right-wing identitarian whites, but fundamentally their job is to write code that does the job of less-compensated whites.\n\n&gt;Now, the solution to this would be rather obvious. Simply legalize the status of the immigrants.\n\nMany on the right don't want immigrants whether they're legal or illegal. Even when people are legal immigrants they often don't assimilate in a way that the identitarian right finds satisfactory. Even when people immigrate legally they often take jobs for less money. It's unfortunately easy to scab when you show up and find that you're already getting paid twice as much as you were in your home country. Not everyone is taught how bad it is to be  scab.Plus, lot of legal immigrants are part of a larger effort at brain drain. You have instances of poorer countries providing their people with free education, free health care, but low wages, and so they come here for a high wage. This is when someone is educated enough to pass a citizenship test and patient enough to jump through all the bureaucratic hoops. A lot of the people who sneak across the border are fleeing conditions where they don't have the time to do that. Maybe their partner abuses them. Maybe their town is plagued by a cartel. Maybe they're being trafficked through a tunnel network as drug mules. These root causes of crime and poverty aren't being addressed. \n\n&gt;For obvious reasons, this is something neither party wants.\n\nI agree.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596412685,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g05newt","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_i2jlu9","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g0586sl","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2jlu9/about_illegal_immigration_particularly_mexico_usa/g05newt/","retrieved_on":1596416985,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"jaxr127","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_qrbr7","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"Then the US should decriminalize drugs and help Mexico stabilize.

The points you raise are standard liberal talking points in defence of open borders.  I get that some on the left have adopted these as sacred dogma, but they don’t withstand analysis.\n\n*people should be able to escape violence and abject poverty*\n\nIdeally, refugee policy would provide exactly this.  But it’s naive to think it does so in its current form.  To be blunt, moving people around the world doesn’t work for the vast majority of those who are suffering violence or poverty. The [failure ](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/australia-and-1951-refugee-convention) of the current arrangements have been documented by the Lowy Institute and others.  Alternatives - such as those which could provide protection to a wider range of at-risk people in their homelands - are ignored by neo-liberal governments because they challenge the globalist narrative, which imagines that open borders are the solution to the world’s social justice problems.\n\n*.. your “plan” to tax imports makes no sense*\n\nOf course, tariffs on their own won’t raise wages in developing countries.  But if we taxed imports produced in sweatshop conditions, or by child labour, or with no environmental controls, we would incentivise those producers to improve wages, conditions and environmental standards in whatever country they’re in.  If Nike has to either pay its Bangladesh workers a fair wage, or cop a 120% tariff on entry to the US or other lucrative markets - maybe they *have to* improve their practices. As a by-product, any funds raised by the tariff could be used to fund international aid.  As with refugee policy, liberals wants no part of any thinking like this, preferring cheap shoes and hollow virtue signalling to anything substantive which helps workers in the developing world.\n\n*..a nation with no right to claim that it’s inhabitants live on any kind of ancestral land*\n\nSpare me.  For 50 years, the people of Europe, North America and Australia/NZ have been ignored on immigration.  When I say ‘the people’ I mean all the people, including indigenous and others.  We have been ignored, not ‘cause racism’ - but because it has served the material interests of business to impose mass immigration.  If you doubt this, look at the corporate complaining about ‘jobs Americans/Britons/Canadians won’t do’.

First and foremost, his idea of collectivization was to set taxes on peasantry - \"to put pressure on kulaks\" and to make village more even. For some reason that would lead to collectivization. He also had his usual idea that USSR should bow down to the West for the industrialization because apparently soviet industry could mechanize agriculture only in \"planner's dreams\". \n\nIf you didn't notice, Stalin didn't increase taxes on the peasantry, kulak, middle or poor - it all would lead to kulak squeezing everything he lost out of his neighbours. Instead we got way better deal - preferential loans for the use of tractors, agronom education for peasantry, mass use of fertilizers and all the good stuff without the increase in taxation.

Tukhachevsky wasn't a traitor, moron.\n\nEDIT: I want to come back to this to just drive home how much of a retard you are. You know what one of the main pieces of evidence used against Tukhachevsky at his trial was? It was Semyon Budyonny (one of Stalin's main cronies in the army) testifying that Tukhachevsky's advocacy for tanks and mechanization of the Red Army constituted \"wrecking.\" This is the faction that Stalin put in charge of the Soviet military. Is it any wonder Soviet tank doctrine was lacking in 1941?\n\n&gt; Eh, this order is from Zhukov and Timoshenko and it says \"during the 22.06.41-23.06.41 germans could suddenly attack, maybe asking for provocation, soldiers are to secretly take firing positions, get ready for war, yada yada\".\n\nThey had to beg Stalin to let them release that order, which, because of all the caveats, nobody took it seriously. Commanders continued to attend concerts, comedies, balls, etc. instead of going immediately to the front because the order was so low-key. Remember, this is all in response to a German communist deserting, crossing a river, and warning the Soviets that the attack was coming early the next morning. And this came after months and months of warnings that the Nazis were going to attack. And yet the order still says it is probably just an attempt to provoke the Soviets into firing first. Absolute retardation.\n\nYou've rebutted nothing. It's clear the Soviets were unprepared on the 22nd. See: most of the Soviet airforce getting blown up on the ground.\n\n&gt; I like HOI4 too, but don't let PDX lib version of history cloud your mind.\n\nHOI4 actually nerfs the Soviets to an insane degree, because if they didn't the Nazis would get absolutely steamrolled in every game as should have happened in

While retreating soviet troops couldn't hold the line because there wasn't enough troops already. \n\n&gt;You know what one of the main pieces of evidence used against Tukhachevsky at his trial was?\n\nDon't just assign \"mainness\" to pieces of evidence. \nThat's Budennyi's impression of the trial (in russian, sorry, the actual letter is on 13th page):\nhttps://msuweb.montclair.edu/~furrg/research/budennyi_klio12.pdf\nThere's no mention of that mechanization thing anywhere. Tukhachevsky said he was a german spy - \"without trading information, only rumor-mongering\" - since 1925. \n\nThere's no text anywhere because trial documents are still top-secret. \n\n&gt;And yet the order still says it is probably just an attempt to provoke the Soviets into firing first.\n\nUSSR moved into a state of war 22.06.41. The day nazis attacked. And first counterattacks - even into East Prussia - happened on 23. Khruschev's claim that Stalin was paralyzed for weeks is just not true, response to germans was immediate but the problems were (according to some historian) lack of communication due to using phone lines due to fear of radio being intercepted and thus lack of cohesion, army supplies falling into german hands very early and \"inexperience of officers\". But before you start making Stalin into a tyrant - remember how Miracle on Vistula happened? That's right, Tukhachevsky overextended and lost communication with other armies because he moved into the territories out of range of radio and with no phone lines to connect back and got surrounded by polish. I kind of see a pattern here.\n\n&gt;HOI4 actually nerfs the Soviets to an insane degree, because if they didn't the Nazis would get absolutely steamrolled in every game as should have happened in history.\nPDX is mostly concerned with making Africa, their war with german subs and invasions of Italy and Normandy as important as whole Eastern Front. Because that's the view of present-day western historians. \n\nUSSR was sandwiched between Nazis, helped at every opportunity by the West from british navy being built out of german steel to Munich Agreement, from blocking and preventing help to anarchists in Spain to doing strange wars with aviation from both sides being forbidden from bombing private property, and Japan, which tried to start a war multiple times before they finally settled with China as their main target.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596520288,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g0asz07","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2irj9","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g08vx8z","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2irj9/he_was_tho/g0asz07/","retrieved_on":1596526585,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"Keesaten","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"chinese nationalist / CCP apologist"}],"author_flair_template_id":"9c224d68-b89b-11ea-96f4-0ebd66811c15","author_flair_text":"chinese nationalist / CCP apologist","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_ixp7a","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"First you go \"who cares if it's small amount\" to pretend that the mere fact of such a trade is condemnation enough, then you go \"trade with soviets propped up german army and was enough alone to sustain it\". Wow.\n\n&gt;So in response to French and the British failing to stop the Nazis you...\n\nThey didn't FAIL to stop nazis, they didn't want nazis to stop. That's why they didn't let czech diplomats in when they decided the terms of czech territory being given to Germany. Also, they didn't let soviet diplomats in either, and they wanted to get in badly. Afterall, Stalin negotiated a defence treaty with Czechoslovakia, but one little clause - that France must join too or the USSR can't invoke the alliance to send help, prevented it. Even so Stalin offered a million troops to help czechs despite the terms of treaty. That wasn't a FAILURE of British and French diplomacy, it was them consciously fanning the flames. As a result USSR got isolated diplomatically and was the only country in Europe without non-agression pact with Germany. Kind of obvious just exactly where nazis were aimed at, so USSR does a NAP with Germany (because Hitler didn't want to just advance british and french interests) and goes for them first. NEVER USSR assumed that Germany would stop there and that they were allies now. In fact, when splitting Poland they got fights all over the place where soviet and german troops came in contact, like in Lvov.

No, the point is for all races to work together. And if it was idpol, which I disagree with, does that make it inherently bad? Why is BLM idpol okay but ALM idpol bad? And genuinely I'd be interested to know, if it was split up further, if we had Latinx Lives Matter would that also be bad?

The thing with an ALM approach is if they are consistent in their protests to brutality, their protests will reflect the percentages at which these groups are targeted. So for example they will have a significantly disproportionate number of protests about black victims, and so on. If someone contends all victims are black then they will be protesting solely black victims anyway. Anyway to your point there have been plenty of white people who have supported BLM, despite some radical elements of BLM being anti-white, so just imagine how many white people may have supported it if they also cared about white victims, or at least didn't brand themselves as exclusively concerned about black victims. \n\n&gt; If you want police reform, that is the avenue. \n\nHopefully so, and there has been some success which is surprising.

know this is kind of off-topic for this subreddit, but I needed to share this here, even if it gets pull down later.\n\nThis is a movie that if not for the quarantine, I would had never seem. There is a couple of posts here about the initial polemic. But what makes this movie entertaining to watch for people of stupidpol is the kind of comedic jabs it takes towards the typical rich white liberal that gets involved in idpol.\n\nIt's not everyday, specially today, that a movie from a big studio like Universal makes fun of things like cancel culture and politically correct language, while also making fun of Trump and the alt-right. The fun thing is the rich liberals getting upset about someone saying black... while they mow down the typical MAGA type in a hunt. But it really points the light towards the hypocrisy and the absurdity of idpol.\n\nFor example, you get the extreme classism of the rich guys doing the hunting. That get upset at their victims because of their racist attitudes, and may appear questioning their privileges... but never the economic ones. Not at any moment they make mention of their class as a problem. Only the fact that one of them is wearing a kimono, because that's cultural appropiation. Or them calling a group of white southeners evil just because of their opinions online, and justifying that way shooting at them with a shotgun. Or how thorough all the movie, they end up accidentally proving right all the insane points and conspiracy theories the far-righters they are chasing make.\n\nI mean, is a very mindless gore comedy, without any real depth beyond the jabs taken at idpol and far-right conspiracy theories, but I enjoyed it. And is exactly the kind of movie the typical member of this sub would enjoy too. \n\nJust if you want to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the current idpol infested social networks, and have something to laugh at about it.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowGYbxTPgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sowGYbxTPgU)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","subreddit_subscribers":43362,"subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"\"The Hunt\" seems like a movie made for members of this sub","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/i2hyym/the_hunt_seems_like_a_movie_made_for_members_of/","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_template_id":"c3d3b84c-b724-11ea-8dbd-0e725323f7b3"},"Comments":[{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"morroia","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Anglos were a mistake"}],"author_flair_template_id":"a786ecca-b2d2-11e8-b488-0e7e76d3701a","author_flair_text":"Anglos were a mistake","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_3iu83tkd","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"I thought you were talking about the Danish movie... which eerily reminds me of cancel culture, now that I think about it.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596398727,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g04xxt5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2hyym","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_i2hyym","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2hyym/the_hunt_seems_like_a_movie_made_for_members_of/g04xxt5/","retrieved_on":1596402874,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"clovecomi","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"something left"}],"author_flair_template_id":"72f2ae6c-8d26-11e8-a036-0eefae9c5502","author_flair_text":"something left","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_cxxc61o","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"This isn't the Mads Mikkelsen movie of the same name, so I'll pass.

It’s definitely possible, just not really something I have the smarts to look for proof for. Some things being said really do seem inflammatory for the sake of starting fights, and pushing your tweet up the trending board will get eyeballs on it, and will start fights. \n\nNow claiming every crazy inflammatory tweet’s popularity was bought and paid for would be silly, too, because enough people have seen stuff by now that there likely *are* people who have internalized those beliefs, people who already were thinking the same thing but needed to see it popularized before they said it and things like that.

I still don't believe, however, that all of this recent heightened coverage of China and its sudden precursors to balkanization are just a coincidence rather than the US' geopolitical doings. The West's soft power relies heavily on its progressivism, appearing enlightened and supporting human rights while blanketing everything they're doing abroad. So it makes sense to portray China as comically dystopian and the coverage of the past 1.5 years or so does just that. Nobody in the West ever gave a damn about the IMF's blatant exploitation of Africa, yet all of a sudden China's getting admonished for doing (so far) less harm than them and also building infrastructure.\n\nSo you know, I'm just a bit skeptical regarding everything said about China and I hope this doesn't turn into Cold War 2.0.

I think you might be missing a beat here but I'd be curious to see (Marxist) people who genuinely believe that ending racism will end capitalism. I've never heard that. No one's saying that racism implies capitalism or that we must first dismantle racism as a necessary condition for dismantling capitalism. Most often I've found the discourse centered around \"you don't get to tell me to wait for black liberation because that's racist and you always do that (which is true to some degree)\" and the other most common one is people not even understanding capitalism (or its dissolution) as a goal or side goal to issues of black liberation. \n\nSo, again, I think you might just be getting the logic inverted - many people say that capitalism requires or guarantees nation-statism/racism/colonialism/imperialism/etc. because these function as mechanisms to suppress class awareness/solidarity and enable value extraction. Thus we have racist colonialism in the 1500s-1900s because it's market-efficient to invade countries and plunder their resources, or steal the people themselves and make them slaves or set up fake governments to get what you want... but we also have Woke Capitalism in 2020 because it's important for your Brand Identity to show that you're The Right Kind of Company That People Can Trust to Support Black People.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596416012,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g05t14o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2bewu","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g03bokp","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2bewu/capitalism_can_totally_exist_without_racism_i/g05t14o/","retrieved_on":1596419972,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"-Succdem-","author_flair_background_color":"#dadada","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Angry Retard 😍"}],"author_flair_template_id":"f5ec3366-b952-11e9-9582-0ed269dffb0e","author_flair_text":"Angry Retard 😍","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_6hafya06","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"\"Capitalism can't exist without racism\" and \"social democracy can only exist in ethnically homogeneous countries\" are pretty much the same argument, despite being from opposite ends of the political spectrum.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596417568,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g05vmqn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i2bewu","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_i2bewu","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i2bewu/capitalism_can_totally_exist_without_racism_i/g05vmqn/","retrieved_on":1596421349,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"-alphex","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Social Democrat"}],"author_flair_template_id":"c13312e0-b724-11ea-ad4b-0e59bfed3611","author_flair_text":"Social Democrat","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_qxynw","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"You typically need somebody (an underclass) to exploit if you want both unregulated free markets and avoid having the majority being against this.

It hurts the working class in the \"source\" countries, it hurts the working class in the \"target\" countries, and it does nothing to develop the economy in the third world. All it does is increase the profit margins of capitalists. Is that your goal?\n\n&gt;To just complain about mass migration without even mentioning these issues is what rightoids do. And many people here, like those I originally replied to, seem to be just that.\n\nYeah, I'm not on their side here. I've replied to their crazy points too.

The bigger picture being a private sector without borders trickling wealth upwards to the elite classes of all nations, and the working classes of all nations being bled dry, and forced to compete with each other for the approval of their masters. Gaddafi also comes to mind, though I wouldn't necessarily call him a Marxist, even though he incorporated elements of Marxism into his philosophy.\n\n&gt;should be taking an active effort to ensure that foreign goods and labor do not take advantage of their people or displace their industries\n\nWhat nation states \"should\" ethically do is entirely at odds with what their actual function seems to be, in practice. Nation states usually conspire against at least some of their people. Often they conspire against all of their people, to different degrees, pitting them against each other in a hierarchy. nation states along with their political elite, their business elite, and their military elite tend to conspire against the working class. \n\n&gt; I don't believe the real solution to the issue is full communist stateless society, as that would quickly devolve into one group that is able to amass more force with which they can exploit others and use the proceeds from their exploitation to fund their exploitation and gain the support of the majority of people.\n\nWell this is what already happens. People scramble to take advantage of power vacuums wherever they appear. The stateless, classless Communist society is something Marx imagined humanity would move towards gradually. I don't think humans will really even be humans anymore, as a species, by the time something like that is achieved. I think it's possible though, in the same way as it's possible for the trillions of cells in your body to cooperate with each other in the name of something bigger (i.e. you).","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596413669,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g05p3fh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i29dld","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g05mlgf","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i29dld/unity/g05p3fh/","retrieved_on":1596417880,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"GoodUsername1337","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_56g49k3m","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"Why are you repeating your retarded comparison all over the thread?","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596413726,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g05p6x4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i29dld","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g05e2pr","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i29dld/unity/g05p6x4/","retrieved_on":1596417932,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"spezisashitstain","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"doomer"}],"author_flair_template_id":"17f49ea4-b726-11ea-9652-0ead669e2cd3","author_flair_text":"doomer","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_48iqntsi","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"I hate to sound like a retard, but the reason noone really is angry about youth entering into the workforce, is because they're supposed to be entitled to it, since they're in the country and the country is supposed to provide jobs for its citizens.

I'm not so sure. \n\nMerely restricting your concerns to the desires of the lower class ignores the needs of those who currently inhabit the middle and upper classes. As a society, we should be striving towards ensuring that all people have a minimum quality of life that ensures that they can readily access food, water, housing, and a fulfilling life. Using \"some people having more than others\" as a moral justification for an ideology creates a race to the bottom where anyone who has any more than another becomes a second class citizen to be exploited. When I see a millionaire on a yacht, I am not under the delusion that it is a sign of exploitation. The materials and labor that went into that yacht wouldn't have produced food, and provided a means of wealth transfer from those who have wealth to those who have the skills to build goods and provide services. However, when that millionaire is funding politicians who would replace me with an unquestioning voter and lower the revenue laborers can acquire through providing goods and services, I don't let emotional manipulation lead me to voting against my own interests to make myself feel morally superior. Those who oppose the nationalist marxists constantly work to oppose any ideology that they cannot exploit for their own gain, and create parties that subvert the ideologies that they proclaim to support in order to dissuade the populace from realizing where the problems they face are coming from. \n\n&gt;What nation states \"should\" ethically do is entirely at odds with what their actual function seems to be, in practice.

There’s a large group of people who work together to make, sell, service, whatever the case may be. The difference is, while the work may be collective, the fruits of their labor, their surplus value, is not collective, it’s privatised by a CEO or board of directors. Socialism says, ‘hey, since we all work together, shouldn’t we share the spoils together?’ It’s not equality of outcome, it’s equality of access. Outcome is determined by the labor you input. **From each according to to his ability, to each according to his needs**. You get out exactly what you put in.\n\nAs socialists, we say capitalism is brilliant at producing, but it is terrible at distributing. We produce more food than we consume, yet millions die of hunger and malnutrition every year. This is because capitalism distributes to those who can pay the most. So, we want to take that brilliant ability to produce that the workers have developed under capitalism, the Means of Production, and instead focus its distribution along humanitarian lines. As I said, we produce more food than we can consume, so we distribute it such that no one goes hungry. There are more empty houses than homeless people America, so I’m abolishing private property, you can then take those empty houses and house the homeless. \n\nAll basic needs and means of subsistence **CAN** be afforded to everyone by right by virtue of the technological advancements we’ve made. \n\nBeyond basic subsistence, people labor, we get bored easy, we’re social creatures.

Corruption works best when it's covert, when you can deflect claims of corruption. That's why do much of investigative journalism now is just accounting, you follow the money because that's the only real hard evidence that exists. Remember that the only reason we know the CIA was behind the crack epidemic in the USA is because it's law to release classified documents after a certain amount of time. Gary Webb originally broke that story (Dark Alliance) and was smeared and black listed by every major publication. He committed suicide shortly before being proven right.\n\nI guess my point is that demanding evidence is often a losing game, if you ever receive the evidence you're looking for it'll be far after the fact and much too late to change anything. Look at the theories themselves, compare that to observable past, and consider the potential pros/cons of such moves by the people doing them. Everyone today has conspiracy brain because we're hyper aware of news and developments but still often lacking the hard evidence we need to unequivocally prove what we've been seeing happen for years. The important thing is to become someone who's skeptical of what they're told and able to rationally decide if a theory makes sense or not given available information, and not become a Qanon psycho

The article mentions the Boston busing controversy, referring back (by a broken link) to an article in the New York Times, which cites Rucker Johnson. From his book released last year:\n\n&gt; Boston had spent thirteen years under the integration order, but it did not achieve lasting integration in that time. Garrity’s order would, in the end, prove a Pyrrhic victory. Because if the goal was to have white and black children learning together, that goal was not achieved. Faced with the prospect of integration, white parents simply fled. It should not be surprising that the Boston suburbs have some of the best public schools in the country, many of them functioning as feeders into the Ivy League. But Boston’s schools continue to flounder. This arrangement is replicated in almost every other American city.\n\n&gt; In 2012, only 13 percent of the children attending Boston’s public schools were white. In 1967, the schools had been 72 percent white. “Now, there are no white kids to be integrated,” one former supporter of busing lamented.\n\n&gt; Hicks and her allies, abetted by an insufficiently critical media, successfully managed to paint busing as a grotesque abuse of power. Busing became a code-word, and those who understood how to appeal to the fears of whites, how to swamp facts with emotions, knew how to use it effectively. Unexamined by many opponents of integration was the assumption that neighborhood schools were indeed a civil right, that one was somehow entitled to attend the closest school possible—and that the government has no say in where, and how, children are educated. The busing wasn’t “forced” any more than parking rules are “forced.” It was a delusion of whites in Boston—and elsewhere—that they had untrammeled freedom to educate their children in whatever school they saw fit. It was an even greater delusion that the busing issue was about anything other than race.\n\nSince my account seems devoted to quoting Lasch, he commented on the issue at length in *The True and Only Heaven*, decades earlier:\n\n&gt; In Charlestown, Massachusetts, the conflict over busing was preceded by protracted conflicts over urban renewal. Here the immediate threat came not from black people pressing into the neighborhood but from advocates of redevelopment, who dreamed of Boston as a model of the “information economy” destined to grow up on the ruins of heavy industry. With a sense of self-importance reminiscent of the city’s seventeenth-century founders, but with little of their moral vision, promoters of redevelopment envisioned the “new Boston” as a city on a hill, a show-place of advanced technology, cosmopolitan sophistication, high finance, and architectural splendor. They had big ambitions for Charlestown, a run-down neighborhood long since forsaken by Protestants, more recently by the more prosperous members of its predominantly Irish population, and finally by the Charlestown navy yard, once the basis of the local economy. Planners saw renewal as a matter of “getting a better grade of person” to live in Charlestown. “Charlestown has a dream,” exclaimed a columnist in the Boston Globe, “a developing dream—to be to Boston what carefully restored, stylish Georgetown has been to Washington.” This was not Charlestown’s own dream, of course, which was typically small-minded in the eyes of the outside world. “We wanted to help people rehabilitate their houses,” said one resident. “We tried to show we could do without the federal government.” For old inhabitants, renewal meant the restoration of the community as it had been in its better days, when “Townies” were self-supporting and respectable and the neighborhood known as one of the safest in the whole city, even after dark.\n\n&gt; A tumultuous session of the Charlestown city council in 1965 approved a plan calling for demolition of 10 percent of private housing, replacement of the state prison with the Bunker Hill Community College, and other dubious improvements. Subsequent plans called for the construction of luxury housing on the site of the old navy yard, complete with swimming pool, tennis courts, and two marinas. “I am concerned with the destruction of families,” said an opponent of gentrification. “We want people back, not a professional man, his secretary, and a dog.” Professional planners, however, cared more about real estate values and a “better sort of person.” The Charlestown Patriot accurately assessed the effect of their efforts when it warned that “Townies” would soon lose the “Charlestown they now know,” if indeed they found themselves “able to live here at all,” in the “backyard of all this luxury.”\n\n&gt; The same coalition that designed and built the “New Boston”—banking and real estate interests, university presidents, foundation heads, and civic leaders, including representatives of the small black elite—welcomed the Racial Imbalance Act passed by the state legislature in 1965 as an opportunity to modernize the city’s school system. Businessmen and their allies dominated the Citywide Coordinating Council, appointed by Judge Arthur Garrity in 1975 as the “eyes and ears of the court,” when his ambitious plan for desegregation began to run into fierce popular opposition.* The Globe described the Coordinating Council as a “mixture of community people, clergy, educators and businessmen,” which promised to provide the kind of “positive, representative, credible” leadership the city had lacked in the recent past. A prominent member of the Coordinating Council, President Kenneth Ryder of Northeastern University, said that it stood for “intelligence, professionalism, absence of political considerations.”\n\n&gt; From the beginning, the civic elite took the position that good schools would bring professionals back into the city, generate tax revenues, and train the skilled work force required by the new high-tech economy. According to a report issued by the Ford Foundation in 1965, improvement of public education was a “prerequisite for holding the middle class in the city.” James M. Howell, a senior vice-president of the First National Bank, spelled out the familiar rationale for school reform: a new emphasis on “marketable skills”; “innovative pilot projects” designed to link “education to job markets”; increased attention to “skills that reflect the technical orientation of area business firms.” Robert Wood, president of the University of Massachusetts and chairman of the Coordinating Council, endorsed the goal of “programs that fit the market place.” When he became superintendent of schools in 1978, he made “career-occupation education” his “first priority.” In practice, this boiled down to the introduction of programs in “computer literacy” and the purchase of expensive equipment from the electronics industry.\n\n&gt; For the business and professional classes, self-interest appeared to coincide with moral idealism—a happy conjunction. Racially integrated and otherwise “innovative” schools would break the hereditary cycle of poverty and make it possible (when accompanied by aggressive programs of affirmative action) for qualified members of the “underclass” to achieve professional status. The only thing that stood in the way of racial justice and civic renewal was the obstinate resistance of “self-enclosed” ethnic “enclaves,” as they were invariably referred to by reformers, which clung to their “small-world insularity and intransigence.” Neighborhoods like Charlestown and South Boston—“peninsulas ethnically rigid and ingrown,” inhabited by “hooligans,” “bigots,” and “hysterical racist mobs”—automatically opposed any kind of innovation, especially if it promised to benefit black people.\n\n&gt; The party of civic improvement could see nothing but racism in their opposition to busing. Mrs. Hicks might denounce Garrity’s order as a solution foisted on the city by “rich people in the suburbs,” the “outside power structure,” the “forces who attempt to invade us”; but “racism” was the “real issue,” in the words of Elaine Noble, a liberal in the state legislature. Jon Hillson, a black liberal, attributed opposition to busing to the “extreme insularity” and “backwardness” of the Irish, “fostered and preyed upon by racist politicians” who knew how to exploit “rude, primitive fear.” Hillson dismissed the claim that “gains won by the civil rights … struggle come out of the pockets of white workers” as an outright “lie” propagated by the “racist alliance that runs America.” Jonathan Kozol, well known for his book Death at an Early Age, an account of his experiences as a teacher in Boston, traced the antibusing movement to “mob terror and decades of miseducation, stirred by demagogues, preplanned by those who feed on hate.” All the violence surrounding the busing controversy, Kozol insisted, derived in the last analysis from the violent resistance initiated by whites. When Michael Faith, a senior at South Boston High School, was stabbed by a black classmate from Roxbury, Kozol managed to convince himself that “it was … Louise Day Hicks … who put the knife in Michael Faith.”\n\n&gt; In fact, Mrs. Hicks had lost most of her supporters in South Boston by this time, precisely because of her condemnation of violence. The stabbing incident directly contributed to the decline of her influence. As word of the assault spread through South Boston, a mob gathered outside the high school and refused to let the black students, trapped inside the building, return to Roxbury. Mrs. Hicks pleaded with the crowd to disperse. Paying no attention to her, the crowd took up one of the least attractive chants of the sixties: “Hell, no, we won’t go!” “She looked scared,” according to a teacher who watched the scene from a window. In the end, the black students were led from the building by a side door while the state police restrained the mob in front.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596378413,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g03o95o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i284w2","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g037m2l","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i284w2/good_white_people_have_this_insidious_new_kind_of/g03o95o/","retrieved_on":1596378880,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"RepulsiveNumber","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_33zqy4fr","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"Continued:\n\n&gt; The wrongs suffered by black people in America were so glaring and their demand for reparation seemingly so compelling that advocates of busing found it impossible to admit that white workers had important grievances of their own, especially when those grievances were couched in the idiom of racial abuse and championed by leaders who exercised no control over their own followers. Liberals were predisposed to see nothing but racial prejudice in the antibusing movement, but the movement itself did very little to correct this misunderstanding. Antibusing agitators sometimes appealed to the example of the civil rights movement, but they had no understanding of its moral self-discipline. They deplored violence but subtly encouraged it by dwelling on the duty to repel the outside “invasion” of their communities. They protested that “although we’re opposed to forced busing, we’re not racists,” in the words of Dennis Kearney, a South Boston politician; but antibusing mobs undermined such claims with their favorite slogan, “Bus the niggers back to Africa!” “We are racists,” said a white senior at South Boston High School. “Let’s face it. That’s how we feel about it.” Ione Malloy, the English teacher who recorded this defiance in her diary of the busing conflict, tried to persuade her students that South Boston’s position was more complicated than that. When students complained that “blacks get everything,” she challenged them to change places. When they threatened to “start trouble so the plan won’t work,” she predicted, quite accurately, that the authorities would close the school. She urged them to avoid violence and provocation, to no avail. As the situation deteriorated, she confessed to a feeling of “futility.” “We seem to be going to a dead end.”\n\n&gt; The best argument against busing was that an “ethnically or racially homogeneous neighborhood respected another community’s integrity more easily than a weak, threatened neighborhood did.” According to this way of thinking, “strong neighborhoods were the solid building blocks of a healthily diverse city.” The “preservation of community,” accordingly, should have been recognized as a “value competitive with—yet ironically essential to—equality.” But these were the words of a sympathetic observer from outside, Anthony Lukas, not an indigenous analysis of the issue. Leaders of the antibusing movement never resorted to this argument. They seldom rose above the level of resentment, self-righteousness, and self-pity. “We are poor people locked into an economically miserable situation,” said Pixie Palladino of ROAR (Restore Our Alienated Rights). “All we want is to be mothers to the children God gave us. We are not opposed to anyone’s skin. We are opposed to forced busing.”\n\n&gt; In default of indigenous leadership, it was left to an occasional outsider or to an ambivalent insider like Ione Malloy to grapple with the difficult question of how to reconcile ethnic solidarity with racial equality. Like other moderates in South Boston—the few who remained by the mid-seventies—Malloy supported integration but shared the local resentment of Garrity’s judge-made law. “A great injustice has been done to the people of South Boston by forcing on them a desegregation plan that didn’t consider the needs of the students or the working-class background of the community.” She admired the community pride she discovered when she attended a meeting of ROAR, but she regretted the community’s effort to make the high school a political battleground. She agreed with a statement passed by the faculty senate that if the black and white communities stayed out, refraining from “agitation in the communities with the students,” the atmosphere in the school would improve.\n\n&gt; An Irish Catholic who grew up in Boston and longed for an “Irish cultural renaissance in South Boston,” Malloy nevertheless understood that the Southie’s creed, “We take care of our own,” represented an “inadequate ideal.” She hoped to “change the self-image of the South Boston youth by giving him a sense of his cultural roots so he could stand strong.” She did not expect to accomplish this, however, by concealing Irish shortcomings or failures, still less by appealing to a precarious sense of racial superiority. Nor did she propose to strengthen Irish solidarity by sealing off South Boston from the outside world. “I would hear, over and over, ‘We just want to be left alone.’” She rejected this simpleminded solution, just as she rejected simpleminded solutions proposed by the other side. As a teacher, she could not accept either of the competing conceptions of education implicit in the battle over busing and more explicit in controversies over school prayers, in broader discussions about the place of religious instruction in the public schools, and in the general conflict between the demand for schools responsive chiefly to parental pressure and the demand for schools governed by an abstract ideal of “excellence.” Malloy took the position, in effect, that the first of these conceptions would simply enforce uncritical adherence to local dogma, while the second would allow a few gifted individuals to escape from their culture into the business and professional class, leaving the rest behind.\n\n&gt; Advocates of busing argued that racially integrated schools would destroy racial stereotypes and promote tolerance. Their more ambiguous effect is illustrated by the case of Vinnie, the only student in Charlestown willing to submit to busing into Roxbury during the first year of the desegregation program. Held up as a model of racial enlightenment in an account of the busing crisis by Pamela Bullard and Judith Stoia, Boston television reporters, Vinnie might better have been seen as a model of social mobility and cultural expatriation. As Martha Bayles noted in a perceptive review, Vinnie was a hero for Bullard and Stoia because he was “just like us.”\n\n&gt; &gt; Unlike his backward and ignorant neighbors, he wants to go to Harvard. Unlike his insular neighbors, he intends to leave Charlestown and never come back…. Unlike his sexually repressed neighbors, he sees no harm in unmarried girls having babies…. The point is that Bullard and Stoia, in their zeal to show how busing has cured Vinnie of racial prejudice, show also how it has cured him of numerous other beliefs and values. Instead of describing a Charlestown boy who has overcome racism, they describe a Charlestown boy who has overcome Charlestown.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately for Judge Garrity’s experiment in racial balance, most of Vinnie’s neighbors did not share his ambition to “overcome Charlestown,” let alone the means to carry it out; but even if they had, they would not necessarily have been the better for it. If racial enlightenment could be achieved only at the price of exile, perhaps it was time to reconsider the whole project of enlightenment.\n\nIt's from his \"conservative\" period, so one can just declare this \"right-wing,\" and end thought there. Still, the quote from the Johnson book suggests that the Irish working class community moved to the wealthy Boston suburbs, yet I suspect that isn't where most of them moved. It seems the professionals who moved into the gentrifying neighborhood send their kids to private schools instead, however.","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596378961,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g03polr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i284w2","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g03o95o","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i284w2/good_white_people_have_this_insidious_new_kind_of/g03polr/","retrieved_on":1596379507,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"Olduvai_Joe","author_flair_background_color":"transparent","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Libertarian Stalinist"}],"author_flair_template_id":"43358fe4-767f-11e9-ad57-0e51ed6b12d8","author_flair_text":"Libertarian Stalinist","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_35tv1","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"Americans with a college degree are twice as likely as those with only a high school diploma to believe that black people are genetically inferior to white people.

Your so-called \"proven benefits\" are pure idealism. \n\nYou're basically offering to cure people of their evil thoughts (classism/racism). That's just not a materialist analysis. People act in their material self interests. \n\nIf you go up to someone and tell them that you're going to save their soul by curing them of racism/classism/other-isms *but* that might lower their property values or create worse school conditions, then guess what they're going to choose.\n\nHappy families with money and great schools don't care if you \"feel\" they're \"backwards\". \n\n&gt;I can’t really understand your comment. Are you arguing against racial balancing? Affordable housing?\n\nI'm absolutely for affordable housing. I don't care about racial balancing one way or the other. People can live where they want as long as everyone has the same right to healthcare, good housing, and good education.\n\nA lot of this comes down to investing money (which raises taxes) into poorer/working class communities (often minorities) and education *within these communities first*.\n\nRight now, many of the minority communities offer a lower tax base (due to lower education/incomes) and have higher crime rates (due to lower socio-economic class). So when they move in, race becomes an easy, messy sign for wealthier families that their neighborhoods and schools are going to get worse.\n\nThat's why the article in the OP talks about the \"racial tipping point\". Sure, if one or two new people move into a neighborhood, the existing community can adopt them fine. But if you see a bunch of lower-economic-class minorities move in (which might affect the tax base of their schools and the crime rates), then yeah, people are going to leave in their own self interest. \n\nAnd unless you plan on banning moving vans, then the phenomenon of \"white flight\" will continue. That's why any integration plan has to make it palatable for families to accept new people into the community.\n\nEven affordable housing, which will have to be done with pure brute force by taxing wealthier families and forcing new developments in their communities, can still be made more acceptable by reducing the chance that their communities will be radically altered (i.e. ensuring that all social services/schools/etc. receive the same funding and that the chance of new crime is lowered).\n\nPeople are always going to be free to move where they want. If you don't invest in raising up lower-economic-class minority communities where they are *before trying to move them en masse to new neighborhoods*, then you'll have the same problem that has plagued desegregation for 60 years - \"white flight.\"","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596392851,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g04ll3a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i284w2","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_g037m2l","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i284w2/good_white_people_have_this_insidious_new_kind_of/g04ll3a/","retrieved_on":1596395922,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"FreezieKO","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_n8j8y","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"&gt;These white people are idiots and don’t want poor people in their schools.\n\nPoorer people bring a lower tax base and higher crime rates.

It’s always seemed odd to me, because Wikipedia is probably the single most efficient ways to browse and retain information, given its use of embedded hyperlinks that’ll help further explain the context behind an event or the object/person being referenced. I think I’ve learned more about history from an objective and ideological basis, as Wikipedia tends to separate chronological events/details from ideological/social responses to said events and details, allowing the reader to gather perspective and understanding without someone trying to force their own ideological perspective into the mix (like how mainstream/mass media interjects ideological messaging into their presentation of current events). The American educational system does the same, with events and dates the American government would rather have not knowing simply being excluded from curriculum nationwide. History is also rewritten to a certain extent, with certain historical figures such as John Brown and Martin Luther King Jr. being taught in drastically different ways depending on when and where one was raised. I was told (in US History this year, as an 11th grader) that MLK Jr. was an example of peaceful protest working and that he modeled his style of protest after those of Gandhi. I was never told that MLK Jr. later ascribed to Marxist principles, who or what Gandhi was truly fighting against, or anything about COINTELPRO and governmental responses to the Civil Rights Movement (at a national level, the curriculum seemed to mostly demonize the actions of states who utilized the national guard and police while completely engaging the FBI and other domestic federal agencies involvements). If one were to for example, Wikipedia MLK Jr., one would likely stumble upon articles or sections detailing the domestic surveillance and intelligence gathering that occurred and targeted King. One might also stumble upon articles detailing COINTELPRO and other shady, extrajudicial government programs that sought to disrupt and successfully destroy the American left. Without a solid understanding of history or ideology, one would still ascribe to liberalism/the Democratic Party as a result of it being the only remotely “left” organization (and by left I mean slightly to the left of what are essentially crypto fascists at this point). It kind of makes sense to withhold a literal treasure trove of historical information, because those who control history control the future (and my elementary school tried to control history by restricting Wikipedia and only allowing students to use “school-appropriate” encyclopedias and books from the library). Not saying that they are, but it definitely makes sense because there’s very little logic in restricting one of the greatest educational/informational resources since the fucking Library of Alexandria if the American public school system truly seeks to “educate”.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","subreddit_subscribers":43250,"subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"Educational Anti-Wikipedia Bias","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/i26j4s/educational_antiwikipedia_bias/"},"Comments":[{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"Keesaten","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"chinese nationalist / CCP apologist"}],"author_flair_template_id":"9c224d68-b89b-11ea-96f4-0ebd66811c15","author_flair_text":"chinese nationalist / CCP apologist","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_ixp7a","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"Wikipedia is edited by random nobodies on the internet.

Its fiscally devolved, so it doesn't really have anything to do with tax brackets and wealth distribution which is normally the primary neolib lever. The three major economic consequences of the EU from my understanding are the free movement of capital, labour, and a shared monetary policy. Free movement of labour i get is anti worker on the whole, for example someone from bulgaria would want to move to france for the higher wages, which puts downward pressure specifically on working class wages in france and causes a brain/labour drain in bulgaria. In what situations is free movement of labour beneficial though, should america not exist as a union because immigration from the poorer states to somewhere like california is depreciating wages? Could the same be said for migration from rural france to paris? As for free movement of capital and monetary union, are they anti worker?\n\n2)Are the age/generational politics going around in popular culture on the same tier as other identity politics like race/religion/sex etc and as such should be ignored for greater focus on the class struggle? A lot of it where i live is often framed around economic issues like wages, wealth distribution and home ownership, and almost seems like 'class-lite'.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","subreddit_subscribers":43238,"subreddit_type":"public","thumbnail":"self","title":"Questions on marxist theory in relation to EU, agepol","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/i230vz/questions_on_marxist_theory_in_relation_to_eu/"},"Comments":[{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"snoo-29348","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"DEPORT ALL RIGHTOIDS "}],"author_flair_template_id":"cce82300-b724-11ea-ae24-0e04e67e7899","author_flair_text":"DEPORT ALL RIGHTOIDS ","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_7a19s72l","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"Some neoliberal issues in the EU include:\n\n- Migrant labor is a huge issue and a lot of it is caused by holes in the freedom of movement fabric. Europeans who can afford to go through the official bureaucratic channels do not end up in Spain picking strawberries. Whether the laborers are from within the EU (let's say, Roma) or migrants from abroad, it's still a problem exasperated by otherwise 'beneficial' laws. \n\n- Increasing privatization of public goods and services. Europe started out very strong on this front, it's true, but neoliberal capitalism is a *monster* and it's chewing up their state foundations too. The pressure to buy private health insurance to cover the slowly-but-steadily deteriorating public health. Private companies propping up local transportation systems. \n\n- Strict standards on protected items which ends up being to the detriment of the local small business. Your grandpa in Italy makes the best authentic Parmesan cheese in the town but he can't sell it on the market anywhere beyond his local area because he needs to get it certified and inspected by an EU agency.  This is an over-the-top example but protected status is a double-edged sword a lot of the time, especially as capital flows around more. \n\n- A huge issue with tax havens. London. The Channel Islands. The whole country of Ireland is running on tax haven cash (a lot of it from American companies like Apple) and it's not going to end well. Channel Islands? And a lot of other EU states have favorable haven policies in some way.\n\n- The way EU shifts around debt. I'm not doing a full rundown on this because it's far too long, but just read up on the way the troika went about in the Greek debt crisis in 2015.\n\n- A general unconcern about pollution and a lot of pressure from the private sector to national governments to look the other way. When multinational corporations that make more money than your GDP tell you to do something, you do it. The EU has some standards but only because the rest of the world is so fucking behind. \n\n- The EU 'famously' does not have a military force, but it is increasingly pouring money into [security and defense](https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/35285/A%20stronger%20EU%20on%20security%20and%20defence). And though not an EU issue, [spending towards NATO](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/european-defense-spending-to-hit-300-billion-by-2021-analysts-say.html) is also up in European member states.\n\n- And on top of that, what better example of EU neoliberalism than the way everyone handled the coronavirus? (inb4 America; yes, I know, but this is about you now) Obviously most countries have had the first wave under control, but the initial response really threw open a lot of ugly cracks in the shell. Italy's [initial request](https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/eu-affairs/122756/investigating-the-eu-response-to-covid-19/) for help was denied.  The EU refused to close Schengen borders for far too long. A few weeks later Germany bans exporting facemasks ... all of these are simultaneously causes and effects of the neoliberal system, feeding into itself until it collapses, as capitalism does. \n\nOn the topic of the Euro, I'll let Mr. Varoufakis cover this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhSg9X3q2gc","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596341513,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g0204l6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i230vz","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_i230vz","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i230vz/questions_on_marxist_theory_in_relation_to_eu/g0204l6/","retrieved_on":1596341524,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"fluffykitten55","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Market Socialist"}],"author_flair_template_id":"061e7af2-b725-11ea-8d96-0e572ba45fd1","author_flair_text":"Market Socialist","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_1vcp87hd","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"The EMU is deeply anti-Keynesian, and allowed a sort of 'neoliberlaism by stealth' in countries with strong social democracy and egalitarian traditions which made a Thatcher type strategy unworkable.   \n\n\nPalast is good and short here:\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/robert-mundell-evil-genius-euro](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/26/robert-mundell-evil-genius-euro)","can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"created_utc":1596347771,"distinguished":null,"edited":"false","gildings":{},"id":"g02852f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_i230vz","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_i230vz","permalink":"/r/stupidpol/comments/i230vz/questions_on_marxist_theory_in_relation_to_eu/g02852f/","retrieved_on":1596347782,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"stupidpol","subreddit_id":"t5_hitz3","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]},{"all_awardings":[],"approved_at_utc":null,"associated_award":null,"author":"SolemnInquisitor","author_flair_background_color":"#dadada","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Blackpilled Walter Rauschenbusch"}],"author_flair_template_id":"62780c96-9508-11e8-aa71-0e40b4488568","author_flair_text":"Blackpilled Walter Rauschenbusch","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_5lbusdea","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"body":"[If you don't want to read, Eddie Dempsey has a short video that goes over how awful the EU is.](https://youtu.be/Mt2IZLe8rmY) \n  \n[The Full Brexit website also offers short analysis that can serve as a launching pad for further research.](https://www.thefullbrexit.com/about)\n  \nIt is not just the \"four freedoms\" of the EU that pose a problem for any incoming reformist government.
