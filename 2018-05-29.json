Identity politics has broken us from a collective of workers into smaller groups of black workers and white workers and gay workers and straight workers. To say that a proper left politics needs to let everyone define themself individually in the most narrow sense possible and then try to negotiate all these different individuals into acting together seems way more toxic to actually achieving something . Instead everyone should define themselves in the broadest sense possible and just work together from that common understanding first. Identity politics is an emphasis on what separates individuals so I don't see how we can 'formulate' identity politics in a way that won't always play to the differences between us as opposed to the commonalities among us.",

Why is a left political movement responsible for solving all problems? It seems to me that we should just pick the type of oppression which is shared among a majority of people - class oppression - and then work on that.\n\nI think what you're actually saying right now is the height of liberal individualism. It's not enough that the left focuses on class issues which apply to a majority of the population. In your mind the left instead needs to take every oppressed individual, defer to their personal identity and internal 'oppression ranking' and somehow take all these differing opinions on policy and combine it in a way that helps everyone and makes no one mad. Honestly it's a sisyphean task, you never will actually get that boulder to the top of the hill. What is achievable is picking a common goal like class politics and asking people to give up a bit of their individuality to help us achieve on the dimension most of us are actually oppressed. If you're staunchly opposed to giving up any individual autonomy to a political movement focused on class I think you need to reconsider whether you're actually 'left' at all.",

That's not \"individualism.\" It's literally collective organizing.\n\nI don't think that type of organizing really works. It puts an emphasis on identitarian groups who happen to 'ally' with each other every once in a while. But at base they're really working towards different goals and those splits will become apparent. The whole reason the left has such a bad problem with splintering is (1) a heavy emphasis on personal, individual identity and (2) an inability to keep bougies out. Tiny groups which focus on specific identities as oppression obviously fail (1) and because they basically never focus on a class-only view they're never able to maintain (2). And then you get a latinx transwoman who attends Wesleyan telling a white male factory worker why he's problematic. It just recreates a wealth/education hierarchy in leftist groups. That's why the class-first view is much more likely to work in practice. It's not perfect, but the modern leftist view of oppression is basically quantitative - count up the oppressed identities and more wins - and I think a class-first view is closer to the structure of actual oppression than that (though neither is perfect).",

                    "body": "You could try responding to what I'm actually saying.\n\nPeople pursuing class struggle in a way that accounts for the multifarious aspects of the working class e.g. race, sex etc, is the origin of the term \"Identity Politics\" that the Combahee River Collective proposed and it's what we should return to. Call it whatever you want; Class struggle, identity politics, intersectionality or something new, it's the only good path forward. Ignoring division instead of addressing it in a productive and multi-pronged way is exactly what the Clintonites want.\n\nAfter all, it was the Clinton who injected this false dichotomy into the primary:\n\n&gt;\u201cNot everything is about an economic theory, right?\u201d Clinton said, kicking off a long, interactive riff with the crowd at a union hall this afternoon. \n\n&gt;\u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow\u2014and I will if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will\u2014would that end racism?\u201d\n\n&gt;\u201cNo!\u201d the audience yelled back.\n\n&gt;Clinton continued to list scenarios, asking: \u201cWould that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the LGBT community? Would that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants overnight?\u201d\n\nShe did that not because she cared about actually addressing those issues but because she's defending the class interest of the Bourgeoisie and the Democratic Machine, by attempting to keep so called \"identity activists\" and labor organizers divided.\n\nThis is the exact origin of our current impasse. This exact same frame as the first Clinton proposed in the 90's. It's what Obama did. Reacting by accepting their false framework and doubling down on some kind of class reductionism which, which lacks solidarity with other struggles, which doesn't account for the multiplicity of experiences and needs of actual working people, sows division and that's precisely why we should reject it. This [article](http://inthesetimes.com/article/18962/break-up-banks-end-racism-and-sexism), a debate between left feminist Moe Tkacik and liberal 'feminist' Amanda Marcotte, is an excellent explanation of the conundrum.\n\n&gt; When I saw this quote on Twitter, I just stared for a few minutes, as if into the abyss or at a really gross zit under a magnifying glass. I didn\u2019t want to know the \u201ccontext\u201d because the statement itself defecated all over the very idea of context.\n\n&gt;Obviously, no one ever promised a piece of legislation would \u201cend\u201d hate and injustice. Anyone even notionally sincere about battling the prejudices and cognitive dissonances that oligarchs and overlords have forever promulgated to divide and conquer humanity understands that \u201cracism\u201d and \u201csexism\u201d are not forces you can arrest with a pen. \n\n&gt;Then there are the banks, the biggest and rottenest of which have been with us for more than two centuries. To want to see them curtailed is to have absorbed more than enough history to understand that such things don\u2019t happen \u201ctomorrow.\u201d \n\n&gt;When I finally caved and read the full speech, I found a veritable orgy of straw men, each catering to some crucial segment of the Democratic coalition. It wasn\u2019t just racism and sexism that would persist in a landscape of smaller banks, according to Hillary Clinton. \u201cGerrymandering and redistricting\u201d would also persist, as would discrimination against immigrants and gays.\n\n&gt;Something about the line just screamed \u201cBill.\u201d Not shit-eating-grin President Bill Clinton at the height of his virility/virulence, but the Clinton of today who is occasionally given to weirdly bitter rants that are simultaneously nonsensical and illuminating, like a warped decoder ring for understanding how the Democratic Party could maintain its monopoly on self-righteous rhetoric while selling short the New Deal and Great Society constituencies that got out the vote all those years: Just remind Democratic voters that Republicans want to outlaw affirmative action and abortion and quarantine everyone diagnosed with AIDS.\n\n&gt;The thing is, we were never dumb enough to sign on to this gutted, soulless, leveraged-buyout version of the Democratic platform. Bill Clinton eked out a White House win with only 43 percent of the popular vote. His triumphant job performance as president is a fiction in which Democrats have been inculcated because his surrogates have so effectively marginalized anyone who dares acknowledge history.\n\n&gt;But when the going gets tough, as it conspicuously has, Hillary (like Obama in 2009, alas) falls back on what worked for Bill, the old New Dem coalition strategy: getting the black community leaders and abortion lobby to get out the vote, the bank lobby to pay for the ad buys and the eternal GOP majority to prevent anything from transpiring that might alienate the bank lobbyists. \n\n&gt;Today, as in 1992, this strategy only works by sacrificing a thing that Hillary now maligns as eggheaded \u201ceconomic theory\u201d but what Sanders supporters see as coherence.\n\n...\n\n&gt;If it felt a bit hyperbolic to identify Hillary\u2019s true nemesis as \u201ccoherence,\u201d well, it wasn\u2019t. The Clintonists don\u2019t want the electorate to make sense of the world\u2014or to link cause and effect.\n\n&gt;If they did, they might begin to see breaking up massive unaccountable money syndicates as a vital step toward achieving racial tolerance and gender equality.\n\n&gt;At some point between the financial crisis of 2008 and the rise of Occupy in 2011, Americans began to understand that predatory lending was the cornerstone of modern finance. Usurious interest rates, extortionate fees and vicious cycles of ever-inflating indebtedness were a phenomenon that united black retirees in Detroit with Mexican day laborers in Hollister, Calif.; underemployed Vassar grads with underemployed University of Phoenix grads; the evaporating coffers of Jefferson County, Ala., and Harvard\u2019s $36 billion endowment. The mechanics and fine print might differ case to case, but the business model was identical, needing two critical ingredients to thrive: a culture efficient at dehumanizing victims, and legal impunity.\n\n&gt;First, at Washington Mutual\u2014picked off for pennies on the dollar in 2008 by TBTF bank JPMorgan\u2014subprime mortgage salesmen who didn\u2019t sell enough predatory negative-amortization mortgages were assigned \u201ctrainers\u201d whose first words were, \u201cDo not feel sorry for \u2018these\u2019 people.\u201d At Wells Fargo, where mortgage executives called minorities \u201cmud people\u201d and \u201cniggers,\u201d salesmen were directed to solicit new customers at African-American churches. Sexual harassment was indisputably rampant in the industry. \u201cMortgage sluts\u201d peopled a 2008 Business Week cover story. Is there a more vivid embodiment of rape culture than the photos of the 2010 Halloween party held by staffers of the Steven J. Baum foreclosure mill?\n\n&gt;Second, no major financial institution is as singly responsible for the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of predatory lending as Citigroup. No other institution has employed as many veterans of the Clinton administration. Merely listing the relevant names could fill the better part of a book, but here are three: Peter Orszag, Jack Lew and Michael Froman. By 2007, Citi\u2019s balance sheet was the biggest on Wall Street\u2014when you included all its off-the-books assets, in any case\u2014and in 2008 Citi became the recipient of the single biggest bailout.\n\n&gt;If any corporate monstrosity was worthy of a breakup, it was Citi. Celebrated analyst Meredith Whitney said so, FDIC chairman Sheila Bair said so, TARP overseer Elizabeth Warren said so and former Citi exec Sallie Krawcheck said as much after she was fired by (serial sex-discrimination lawsuit defendant) Vikram Pandit.\n\n&gt;No one listened. Warren and Bair were marginalized\u2014dismissed for failure to be seen as \u201cteam players\u201d by the Clinton/Citi alums who infested the Obama White House. Nevertheless, a lot of powerful men came around, including Larry Summers and then (unbelievably) former Citi CEOs Sandy Weill and John Reed, both of whom wrote op-eds arguing that Glass-Steagall needed to be reinstated and their old bank broken up.\n\n&gt;Hillary thinks otherwise\u2014that we have not yet reached the hypothetical in which \u201cthey deserve it.\u201d Could that be because Citi, in its current and apparently invincible state, is the second biggest donor to her campaign?\n\nThis divide is a fabrication and the capitalists are laughing as long as you accept this framework. Whether you're a Clintonite lib or a reductionist labor organizer, they still win.",

My understanding of universalism is when the people and groups that are excluded from this [definition of] universal rise up and claim their autonomy to produce a new kind of universality.** It\u2019s not something that pre-exists; it\u2019s a break with the existing state of things. \n\n...\n\n&gt;We\u2019d be able to see a new universalism if these rigid divisions between so-called identity categories like race and gender and the category of class were overcome in a real, practical movement. If we were able to see organizations emerge and make real, concrete change in which they bridge those gaps \u2014 in which it would become impossible to say that \u201cthis is a white organization\u201d or \u201cthis is a male-dominated organization\u201d \u2014 **it would necessarily involve challenging economic inequality and the class structures of American society. For a movement to arise, which tackled the fundamental structures of inequality, domination, and exploitation in American society in such a way that identity as a force of division could not exist \u2014 that would be a real universal moment.**\n\nHe's explicitly saying that identity politics arises out of false universalism and that the only way to end that division is to address it, not to ignore it.\n\n&gt;No, what the Clintonites want is to ignore class. They want us to talk about identitarian divisions instead of class.\n\nThat's what I said.\n\n&gt;She's using identity politics to divide the working class.\n\nCorrect, a version of it. That's what I said. Why do you think that's a rebuttal?\n\n&gt;Obama and Clinton have never advocated class reductionism.\n\nI didn't say they did. But accepting their framework by engaging in it is still what they want.\n\n&gt;Class reductionism is meaningless as a term and connotes no recognizable current of leftist politics. Identitarians claim to be fighting against class reductionism because fighting against class solidarity doesn't sound as nice.\n\nTell that to [Asad Haider](https://www.seattleweekly.com/news/a-marxist-critiques-identity-politics/)\n\n&gt;**I don\u2019t subscribe to any class reductionism, because I think that puts things entirely the wrong way. When we\u2019re trying to understand very concrete problems of the role of race in a movement or in American society, and someone says \u201cWell, is race or class more important here?\u201d, that\u2019s a completely obfuscatory way to use Marxist language.** That would be going from the concrete to the abstract, whereas the materialist method Marx proposed was to go from the abstract to the concrete. OK, what would that mean? We have to take this abstraction in our heads\u2014race\u2014and add in the complexity of all the things that determine it, and bring it to the concrete particularity of material life. **That means we can\u2019t settle some kind of question like \u201cIs race or class more important?\u201d as an abstract theological debate.**\n\n&gt;We have to look at our real material situation and our real political conjuncture. When we do that, that\u2019s when we can get a politics that deals with the variety of forms of oppression. **I think that when people make the argument that class is more fundamental than race because it has to do with the fundamental human needs of food and shelter and so on, it\u2019s simply a nonsense statement. It\u2019s an idealist kind of statement,** because obviously if someone is shot by a policeman, it doesn\u2019t matter if the policeman was thinking \u201cI\u2019m shooting you because of your race\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m shooting you because you\u2019re poor and don\u2019t belong in this neighborhood.\u201d What matters is the bullet in your back and the institution that put it there. It\u2019s a material phenomenon that has to be explained and understood in terms of the real history of the social structure\u2014not in terms of moral pieties, but also not in terms of totally abstract schemas that make some kind of appeal to human nature or social psychology.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Class solidarity accounts for the multiplicity of experiences by its very definition.\n\nIn theory, but in practice it only does so if it can address and account for multiplicity and division, rather than ignoring it or ranking it, as Haider points out.",

As Collective member Demita Frazier recalled in a 1995 interview with Sojourner:\n\n&gt;&gt;I never believed that Combahee, or other Black feminist groups I have participated in, should focus only on issues of concern for us as Black women, or that, as lesbian/bisexual women, we should only focus on lesbian issues. It\u2019s really important to note that Combahee was instrumental in founding a local battered women\u2019s shelter. We worked in coalition with community activists, women and men, lesbians and straight folks. We were very active in the reproductive rights movement, even though, at the time, most of us were lesbians. We found ourselves involved in coalition with the labor movement because we believed in the importance of supporting other groups even if the individuals in that group weren\u2019t all feminist. We understood that coalition building was crucial to our own survival.\n\n&gt;Lilla not only shows himself to be petty and ignorant in describing this important activist work as \u201cpseudo-politics,\u201d he also undermines the whole premise of his argument. The Combahee River Collective\u2019s practice was not strictly limited to the identity of individual activists, but was rather about forming coalitions and expanding the scope of what could be demanded politically.\n\nAnd on the need for overcoming division through confrontation and solidarity rather than ignoring it:\n\n&gt;If socialists fail to actively oppose white supremacy, they allow capital to wield one of its deadliest weapons. **In order to build a mass anti-capitalist movement\u2014in order to foster the kind of solidarity, commitment, and collective action that is required for social transformation\u2014it is necessary to oppose every expression of racial hierarchies and divisions which are visible in our society and reassert themselves in our movements.** This is not to make movements \u201csafe spaces,\u201d but to make them expansive and powerful; it is not for white people to act as \u201callies,\u201d but for them to reject the privileges conferred by whiteness in order to be able to act as comrades. Wherever racial oppression threatens the safety of a portion of the multiracial working class\u2014whether it is an ICE raid, a police killing, or a fascist rally\u2014socialists must be at the front lines in our collective defense.\n\n\nAnd further,\n\n&gt;An effective political practice involves, as Judith Butler puts it, \u201cestablishing practices of translation\u201d between the differing demands of the groups that form a coalition, and eventually finding that \u201cdespite any apparent logical incompatibility,\u201d these demands \u201cmay nevertheless belong to an overlapping set of social and political aims.\u201d Today, this process of translation has led far beyond the Sanders campaign and the electoral arena in general, with young people seeking out alternative modes of organization and political struggle.\n\nHe doesn't call these form of solidarity \"identity politics.\" You usually do. Whatever you call it it's what's needed.\n\n\n",

                "selftext": "Angela Nagle has often been accused of accepting the far-right's arguments at face value, and even being a \"crypto\" herself. Rather than exploring the thousands of inane social media messages that gave propelled this smear campaign, we will focus on the most prominent case: Charles Davis' attack on Nagle in the \"liberal\"-patriotic (formerly center-right-patriotic) *Daily Beast* and the associated article in LibCom.  \n\n# Overview\n\nIn his column \"*[Sloppy Sourcing Plagues \u2018Kill All Normies\u2019 Alt-Right Book](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kill-all-citations-sloppy-sourcing-plagues-kill-all-normies-book-on-sjws-and-the-alt-righ)*\" (05/19/2018) - which went through three revisions ([1][DavisRev1][2][DavisRev2]. Nagle's book is a journalistic and ethnographic exploration into the 4Chan fascism and the culture wars. The book indeed suffers from a lack of citations, consistent with the publisher's editorial standards and the general lack of citable peer-reviewed research into the disreputable subjects of trolling and the petty idiocies of contemporary idpol.\n\nDavis's primary objective is to cast doubt on Nagle's critique of contemporary idpol:\n\n&gt; Did the excesses of politically correct leftists on the internet\u2014the sort derided for their focus on identity and pronouns\u2014help fuel the rise of white supremacy and the \u201calt-right\u201d in the United States? That\u2019s the premise of Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars from 4chan and Tumblr to Trump and the Alt-Right, and it is one found persuasive by liberals and conservatives alike, the work widely praised for its author\u2019s unique expertise.\n\nIn the article, Davis accused Nagle of [plagiarism][DavisRev1]:\n\n&gt; several passages in her 120-page work are lifted verbatim from Wikipedia and another online encyclopedia, RationalWiki. Attribution is haphazard throughout, sometimes creating the impression that others\u2019 research is the author\u2019s own. This also leads the author to repeat others\u2019 mistakes. \n\nNagle published a detailed [rejoinder][Nagle] to the plagiarism accusations, arguing that the offending were not copied verbatim and contained common knowledge as opposed to somebody else's original research. Following the rejoinder the Daily Beast retracted the accusation of \"verbatim\" plagiarism, and Davis [modified][DavisRev2] the article.\n\nIn addition to pedantry, Davis also cites a politically charged line of attack (making it more prominent in the revision) essentially alleging Nagle's sympathies for the far right. In this context, Davis notes the missing quotation marks around Dugin's definition of Third Positionism:\n\n&gt; The Wikipedia entry for Dugin\u2019s theory uses the same language as Nagle, with a key difference: It makes clear this is not a neutral observer\u2019s definition, *but the description put forward by Dugin himself*. \u201cDugin states that he is laying the foundations for an entirely new political ideology, the fourth political theory, which integrates and supersedes the three past \u2018theories\u2019 of liberal democracy, Marxism, and fascism,\u201d\n\nDavis and LibCom also attach special importance to Nagle's \"sloppiness\" on the issue of trans activism on campuses and online. A rebuttal of this line of attack can be found [here](http://www.carlbeijer.com/2018/05/libcoms-criticism-of-kill-all-normies.html)\n\nSumming up his revised piece, Davis notes, with some even-handedness:\n\n&gt; It is true, as Nagle\u2019s publisher noted in their statement, that those who first alleged plagiarism in Kill Are Normies are by no means fans of Nagle or her book, her copying and pasting aside. Libcom, for instance, has been unsparing in its criticism of Nagle, seeing her as advancing a socially conservative form of leftism. Harman, an editor there, told The Daily Beast he thinks \u201cshe recycles right-wing talking points about \u2018identity politics,\u2019\u201d arguing that her reliance on the self-definition of a Russian extremist, Aleksandr Dugin, illustrates this.\n\n&gt; In the case of Nagle describing a Russian fascist\u2019s politics in his own words, the problem is almost certainly not a conscious decision to parrot a right-wing nationalist but an unforced error born of haste\u2014one that demonstrates the maxim, \u201cEveryone needs an editor,\u201d with the best viewing a writer\u2019s work with an eye as skeptical as that of their harshest critic.\n\n\n## Left-Com Horseshoe\n\nTo substantiate the accusation, Davis relies primarily on a [blog post][LCNagle]  in *LibCom.org*, a web publication with an anarchist and Left-Communist orientation. LibCom has published voluminous critiques of so-called \"Red-Brown\" politics in general and had (by Davis's [own admission][DavisRev2]) an ax to grind against Nagle's criticism of SJW-politics in particular. Due to a lack of familiarity with fascist and regime politics in countries like Russia, LibCom sometimes substituted [pearl-clutching alarmism and conspiracy theorizing][LCRedBrown] for real analysis (which can be seen as mirror image of the Kremlin's equally pathetic NATO-Fascist-Islamist narrative about Syria and Ukraine). Davis himself is eager to promote the Red-Brown-Putinite narrative, as part of his ideological battle battle against left-wing supporters of the Syrian dictatorship. Oddly enough, LibCom's Antifa politics are compatible their site serving as  largest online [platform](http://archive.is/arozB) for the ideas Italian ultra-left Marxist Amadeo Bordiga, who once called anti-fascism the \"most sinister\" product of Fascism, and fought against (as did the Third Period KPD) attempts by Italian Communists to form a broader anti-fascist alliance against the Blackshirts  on the eve of Mussolini's rise. Characteristically, [Bordiga wrote in 1921](https://overland.org.au/2017/11/against-anti-fascism-amadeo-bordigas-last-interview/):\n\n&gt; Fascists and social-democrats are but two aspects of tomorrow\u2019s single enemy.\n\nSeveral of Bordiga's followers went on to become prominent [Holocaust deniers][BordigismDenial] - a trend started by the revisionist essay \"[Auschwitz, or the Great Alibi][Alibi](authorship is disputed). Bordiga himself was expelled from the Italian Communist Party following his releases from prison in 1930, and had maintained an amicable relationship with OVRA agents throughout the 30s and 40s (during the Mussolini regime). Bordiga expressed [critical support](http://archive.is/WdOlG#selection-1527.1-1609.1) for the Axis powers on many occasions, both to OVRA agents and left-wing acquaintances, and reiterated this position in his publications after the war.\n\n# Davis Horseshoe\n\nAs late as 2010, Davis was a [critical supporter of Ron Paul and the Oath Keepers militia](https://twitter.com/exiledonline/status/974358179239866368), arguing for left-wing collaboration with the nativist-libertarian right against the liberal hawks. This speaks for itself.\n\nCharles Davis also supports of \"no-platforming\" in the hysterical sense of that term: the idea that no-platforming rightists and bigots is a *moral obligation* for all anti-fascists, rather than tactical choice for some, and therefore that anyone violating this principle is playing Red-Brown politics. Guilt by association with \"fascists\" is seen as a valid argument in this context. For Davis, Nagle's opposition to the de-platforming of Germane Greer, Jeremy Bretcher's 2008 pro-immigration article in the far-right Taki's Mag (2008), Mark Ames' association with Eduard Limonov, and American left-wingers' appearances on Sputnik and RT are all symptoms of what the like-minded Antifa author [Andrew Reid Ross](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/09/update-multipolar-spin-how-fascists-operationalize-left-wing-resentment) called \"the fascist creep.\"\n\nIt is therefore ironic that Davis chooses to write for the Daily Beast, which not only turns out volumes of [liberal][DBSample1] and [neoconservative][DBSample2] pseudo-McCarthyite think-pieces, but regularly publishes [Ronald Radosh](https://www.thedailybeast.com/author/ronald-radosh), a notorious Franco supporter and longtime collaborator of the [far-right hate figure David Horowitz][Hor]. Here's Radosh in his own words:\n\n&gt;  \"I think it's fine that Franco won,\" Radosh says casually. \"His repression was fierce, but not as fierce as it probably would have been under the Red Terror.\" \"[The fascist regime] paved the way for a transition to a truly democratic and popular republic.\"\n\nCompleting the horseshoe is Roosh V's [glowing endorsement of Davis' article](https://twitter.com/AngNagle/status/999167366880776192)\n\n## Moral of the story\n\n[Don't throw around allegations of red-brown politics *unless* you know what you are talking about.](https://twitter.com/MarkAmesExiled/status/999791163174543360). Don't be a \"promiscuous critic\".\n\n\n\n[Nagle]: http://archive.is/yeGZb\n[DBSample1]: https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-putin-played-the-far-left\n[DBSample2]: http://web.archive.org/web/20180517025344/https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-bannon-trumps-top-guy-told-me-he-was-a-leninist\n[LCRedBrown]: https://libcom.org/library/investigation-red-brown-alliances-third-positionism-russia-ukraine-syria-western-left\n[LCNagle]: https://web.archive.org/web/20180503181812/http://libcom.org/blog/angela-nagles-plagiarise-any-nonsense-03052018\n[DavisRev1]: https://web.archive.org/web/20180520050418/https://www.thedailybeast.com/kill-all-citations-sloppy-sourcing-plagues-kill-all-normies-book-on-sjws-and-the-alt-right\n[DavisRev2]: https://web.archive.org/web/20180528224811/https://www.thedailybeast.com/kill-all-citations-sloppy-sourcing-plagues-kill-all-normies-book-on-sjws-and-the-alt-right \n[Hor]: https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/david-horowitz\n[Rad]: http://web.archive.org/web/20170927045758/http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org:80/9910/radosh.html\n[BordigaAntifa]: http://web.archive.org/web/20171124090312/https://overland.org.au/2017/11/against-anti-fascism-amadeo-bordigas-last-interview/\n[BordigaLC]: http://archive.is/arozB\n[BordigismDenial]: http://archive.is/sBQDn\n[Alibi]: https://www.marxists.org/subject/jewish/bordiga/auschwitz.htm\n[BordigaFascism]: http://archive.is/WdOlG#selection-1527.1-1609.1u",
